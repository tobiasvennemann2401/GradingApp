MX.16a.140.1	MX_16a	0.0	No because one has more water.
MX.16a.206.1	MX_16a	0.0	No, because they do not say how much spoons are in there and 250 milliliters is more concentrated.
MX.16a.243.1	MX_16a	0.0	No. Because one has more water.
MX.16a.277.1	MX_16a	0.0	No because it has to be equal.
MX.16a.291.1	MX_16a	0.0	No, because one has more water.
MX.16a.366.1	MX_16a	0.0	No they do not because they are not the same amount of water and it will not equal the same.
MX.16a.381.1	MX_16a	1.0	Yes, because if you get the same amount of water from each then weighed it they would measure up to the same amount.
MX.16a.386.1	MX_16a	0.0	No, because there is less room for the solute to spread out in Mariella's solution. The material at the bottom is not part of the solution.
MX.16a.389.1	MX_16a	0.0	Yes because they both have the same amount of solid.
MX.16a.390.1	MX_16a	0.0	No because they have the same solid but different amounts of water.
MX.16a.394.1	MX_16a	2.0	Yes, the solutions have the same concentration because, using the same solute and water, there is a saturation point per milliliters of water and they have both reached the saturation point, they are saturated and cannot become any more concentrated, so they are both equally concentrated.
MX.16a.416.1	MX_16a	0.0	No, they do not because Richard put more water which will make it less concentrated.
MX.16a.437.1	MX_16a	0.0	No. I think that Mariella's saturated solution is more concentrated because it has more solid.
MX.16a.453.1	MX_16a	0.0	No because one has more water which will make the solution heavier than the other.
MX.16a.463.1	MX_16a	2.0	Yes because if they are saturated, then the stuff on bottom went to waste and the waters are holding the same number of water and solid except for the stuff on the bottom. Take that stuff out then they both have the same concentration.
MX.16a.464.1	MX_16a	0.0	No, because the 100 milliliters of water is more concentrated because it has less solvent and 250 milliliters of water has more solvent.
MX.16a.466.1	MX_16a	0.0	No because if you had Kool-aid the one with more water will give the powder more space to dissolve, but the one with less water will saturate because there is less space for the powder to dissolve.
MX.16a.488.1	MX_16a	2.0	Yes because they both cannot hold any more solid.
MX.16a.494.1	MX_16a	1.0	Yes. They are both saturated which means they are also concentrated.
MX.16a.528.1	MX_16a	0.0	No. Why because one has 3 spoons of salt in it and 2 has 4 spoons of salt in it that is why it is more solution.
MX.16a.557.1	MX_16a	0.0	No, because it might be a different amount of the solid in it.
MX.16a.564.1	MX_16a	1.0	I think yes because it does not matter how much whatever you put in it and they put the same amount of stuff.
MX.16a.566.1	MX_16a	1.0	Yes, because if you take out the same amount of water out of each solution and put them on a balance then they will weigh the same. Only a certain amount of water can hold a certain amount of salt.
MX.16a.572.1	MX_16a	0.0	No it does not because the 250 is more than 100.
MX.16a.573.1	MX_16a	1.0	Yes because if you take out a certain amount of water out of each of them and weigh them and they will weigh the same.
MX.16a.576.1	MX_16a	0.0	No, the one with 100 milliliters of water is more concentrated because the solid has less room.
MX.16a.584.1	MX_16a	0.0	No because Richard has more water than Mariella and Mariella only has 100 milliliters of water. And it is more crowded with 100 milliliters of water.
MX.16a.592.1	MX_16a	0.0	No, because Richard has more concentration space than Mariella because he has more water which means less saturation room.
MX.16a.597.1	MX_16a	0.0	Yes, because they are both saturated and if they add more it will just become more saturated.
MX.16a.598.1	MX_16a	1.0	Yes. Because they both put sort of the same amount of water into the cup and so they both have the same concentration.
MX.16a.601.1	MX_16a	0.0	No, because Mariella's solution had more water.
MX.16a.606.1	MX_16a	1.0	Yes there is the same amount of solution.
MX.16a.611.1	MX_16a	0.0	No, because if they did then both the water would be the same.
MX.16a.644.1	MX_16a	0.0	No because Richard has way more solution than Mariella so it is not the same amount.
MX.16a.436.1	MX_16a	0.0	No because Mariella's is more concentrated because her's has less water so it is taste more sweeter or saltier.
MX.16a.492.1	MX_16a	1.0	Yes because they both have the same amount of water.
MX.16a.497.1	MX_16a	1.0	Yes, because if the same amount of solute and make a saturated solution the concentration would be the same if the solutions had the same volume.
MX.16a.636.1	MX_16a	0.0	No because one has 100 milliliters of water and the other has 250 milliliters of water.
