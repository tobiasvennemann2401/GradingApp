EM.48b.121.1	EM_48b	2.0	Because on the key alum is a hexagon with a box in it and lines on the net observation it is the same.
EM.48b.139.1	EM_48b	1.0	Because the crystals in the circle are the same as the crystals in the alum square.
EM.48b.154.1	EM_48b	1.0	The picture looks like the alum.
EM.48b.179.1	EM_48b	1.0	Because of its shaped like a hexagon with a square inside.
