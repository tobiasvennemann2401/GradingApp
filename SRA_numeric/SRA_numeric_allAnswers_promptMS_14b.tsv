MS.14b.101.1	MS_14b	0.0	He can use is volume because he can use it.
MS.14b.108.1	MS_14b	1.0	Because I added the 20 and the 10.
MS.14b.112.1	MS_14b	0.0	Because it is already 30 and it is too heavy. So 20.
MS.14b.136.1	MS_14b	0.0	I chose the answer because I needed to add it together.
MS.14b.143.1	MS_14b	0.0	The ball is too heavy.
MS.14b.146.1	MS_14b	2.0	I chose this answer because it could not be 30 grams because the ball is lower so it must be 40 grams.
MS.14b.152.1	MS_14b	0.0	I chose this answer because one of the blocks said 20 grams.
MS.14b.171.1	MS_14b	0.0	Because if you have a 20 mass piece and a 10 mass piece you have 40 grams all together.
MS.14b.174.1	MS_14b	1.0	I counted the grams and got 30 grams.
MS.14b.183.1	MS_14b	1.0	I got this answer because I counted 20 grams and 10 grams and it equaled 30 grams.
MS.14b.190.1	MS_14b	1.0	Because 20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30 grams.
MS.14b.276.1	MS_14b	0.0	I chose 20 grams because there is 20 grams plus 10 grams 30 grams that way I know how much is it.
MS.14b.282.1	MS_14b	0.0	Because it was the cups that I saw and it was 20 grams and 10 grams to see.
MS.14b.291.1	MS_14b	1.0	I think that is the answer 20 plus 10 equals 30.
MS.14b.315.1	MS_14b	0.0	So I would get the right answer.
MS.14b.319.1	MS_14b	2.0	I can see the ball is heavier than 30 grams because it is not a perfect balance and the level is not perfect.
MS.14b.347.1	MS_14b	1.0	Because 30 is not high enough.
MS.14b.360.1	MS_14b	1.0	I chose this answer because in the mass has 20 and 10 grams and the equals 30 grams.
MS.14b.382.1	MS_14b	1.0	That they ball in the cup and the mass pieces are in this cup. 20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30.
MS.14b.391.1	MS_14b	2.0	I chose it because there is a 20 grams piece and a 10 grams piece but the ball is not even with the other side so it must weigh more.
MS.14b.396.1	MS_14b	0.0	Because the mass pieces gives you the answer.
MS.14b.398.1	MS_14b	2.0	I chose it because the mass pieces are 30 grams. So I did the highest number.
MS.14b.400.1	MS_14b	1.0	Because it is very simple I added 20 plus 10 and it equaled 30 grams. And that is how I got my answer.
MS.14b.417.1	MS_14b	2.0	Because in the cup there are 30 grams. So I picked 40 because 30 grams is not enough so I put 40 grams.
MS.14b.426.1	MS_14b	1.0	Because I carried a ball before and it felt like to me it is 30 grams.
MS.14b.452.1	MS_14b	0.0	I put answer b because 20 plus 10 equals 30.
MS.14b.463.1	MS_14b	0.0	Because if you see it is that because I chose it.
MS.14b.488.1	MS_14b	1.0	Because 20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30 grams.
MS.14b.501.1	MS_14b	2.0	Because a ball is heavy, and if you put in 10 grams it will probably weight.
MS.14b.532.1	MS_14b	2.0	20 plus 10 equals 30 and that is smaller than the ball which must be C.
MS.14b.566.1	MS_14b	1.0	Because 20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30 grams.
MS.14b.569.1	MS_14b	0.0	Because the ball cannot be 40 grams or 20 grams it has to be 30 grams because the ball it little.
MS.14b.592.1	MS_14b	0.0	Because there is no standard unit.
MS.14b.594.1	MS_14b	1.0	Because 30 grams and 20 grams is much big.
MS.14b.595.1	MS_14b	1.0	20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30 grams.
MS.14b.599.1	MS_14b	1.0	Because 20 grams and 10 grams is 30 grams.
MS.14b.116.1	MS_14b	1.0	Because 10 grams plus 20 grams is 30 grams.
MS.14b.294.1	MS_14b	1.0	I chose that answer because left side is heavy than the right side I think that is the answer.
MS.14b.499.1	MS_14b	2.0	I chose it because 20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30 grams and the ball is heavier that is why I chose it.
MS.14b.571.1	MS_14b	2.0	Because it is not 30 because they already show you so it must be 40.
