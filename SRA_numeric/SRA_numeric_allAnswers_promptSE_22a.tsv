SE.22a.106.1	SE_22a	0.0	That they both are at 5, 10, 15, 20.
SE.22a.110.1	SE_22a	2.0	The covered one get hotter than the uncovered ones.
SE.22a.114.1	SE_22a	0.0	It tells about using the solar water heater on the data chart.
SE.22a.127.1	SE_22a	2.0	The one is that are cover they heat up more sun and it gets hotter.
SE.22a.130.1	SE_22a	2.0	That covered sometimes gets the hottest.
SE.22a.155.1	SE_22a	0.0	That the sun absorbs more heat, with dark colors.
SE.22a.157.1	SE_22a	0.0	Is that covered is more lighter.
SE.22a.158.1	SE_22a	2.0	That by being covered the colors attract more heat.
SE.22a.160.1	SE_22a	2.0	Blue was the darkest color and it was covered and that is how it got hotter.
SE.22a.162.1	SE_22a	2.0	That the cover absorbs more heat.
SE.22a.163.1	SE_22a	2.0	It absorbs more heat.
SE.22a.179.1	SE_22a	2.0	It tells if you use a cover it gets hotter than not using a cover.
SE.22a.188.1	SE_22a	0.0	It tells me because they are air in different position. And they are more longer than covered.
SE.22a.190.1	SE_22a	2.0	When you cover the container you get more heat than uncovered.
SE.22a.192.1	SE_22a	0.0	The blue covered have more time than red covered.
SE.22a.243.1	SE_22a	0.0	How the temperature goes upward down.
SE.22a.244.1	SE_22a	2.0	With a cover it does make it warmer but I think it depends on what color is underneath it.
SE.22a.245.1	SE_22a	2.0	If something is covered with a dark color it will receive more heat from the sun and the heat will stay in.
SE.22a.246.1	SE_22a	0.0	That the solar heat is getting hotter. And that it is up to about 20 minute almost to 25.
SE.22a.335.1	SE_22a	0.0	Because it goes to the side and all different ways.
SE.22a.396.1	SE_22a	2.0	That it will heat up faster than uncovered would.
SE.22a.397.1	SE_22a	2.0	Heats up faster.
SE.22a.399.1	SE_22a	0.0	Covering keeps the heat inside the container.
SE.22a.407.1	SE_22a	2.0	It heats up faster.
SE.22a.432.1	SE_22a	0.0	It tells me that if you use a cover the water will heat.
SE.22a.439.1	SE_22a	2.0	It tells you that using a cover can make the water hotter because it is trap.
SE.22a.499.1	SE_22a	2.0	It tells you that it will heat up faster.
SE.22a.503.1	SE_22a	2.0	It the solar water heater has a cover it is going to get hotter.
SE.22a.506.1	SE_22a	2.0	It gets hot faster with covered because when water starts to get hot no air comes in it starts to get hotter.
SE.22a.528.1	SE_22a	0.0	It will kept on raising and raising.
SE.22a.533.1	SE_22a	2.0	It tells me if you put a red uncovered it will not heat as much, If you put a red covered it will heat more than the red uncovered.
SE.22a.539.1	SE_22a	2.0	The graph show that using a cover heats up the water on absorbs heat faster than without a cover because if it has a cover the breeze will not blow away the heat of the surface of the water.
SE.22a.565.1	SE_22a	0.0	That the blue covered one is the hottest and the red uncovered one is the coldest.
SE.22a.580.1	SE_22a	2.0	By saying that the covered one get more hotter and the darker it is it is going to end up hot.
SE.22a.612.1	SE_22a	2.0	The graph tells us that the blue covered will get hotter because with the lid it got much more hotter.
SE.22a.382.1	SE_22a	2.0	That the uncovered items are colder than the covered items.
SE.22a.523.1	SE_22a	2.0	If the heater is covered the water is hotter faster.
SE.22a.532.1	SE_22a	0.0	The covered container can conceal heat.
SE.22a.561.1	SE_22a	2.0	That it maybe gets hotter than uncovered.
