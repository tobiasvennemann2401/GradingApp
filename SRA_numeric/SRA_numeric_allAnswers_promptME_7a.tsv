ME.7a.101.1	ME_7a	1.0	He could not because the 2 wires need to be touching.
ME.7a.120.1	ME_7a	2.0	He can use the circuit by touching the wires to the object.
ME.7a.141.1	ME_7a	1.0	To see if the energy goes through it or not to make a circuit.
ME.7a.146.1	ME_7a	1.0	Lee can touch the wire hangout and the meter will ran.
ME.7a.147.1	ME_7a	1.0	The wire have to be together so it can work so if they out They cannot work.
ME.7a.148.1	ME_7a	2.0	Put the 2 wires that are off the board and put them to each end of the object. If the motor runs it is a conductor. If the motor does not run it is an insulator.
ME.7a.149.1	ME_7a	1.0	He can by putting the 2 wires together.
ME.7a.152.1	ME_7a	1.0	Touch the wires together.
ME.7a.153.1	ME_7a	2.0	You can touch one wire on one end and the other on the other side to see if it will run or not.
ME.7a.154.1	ME_7a	1.0	He could get a piece of metal or iron and put it between the 2 wires and turn the switch on or you could put the 2 wires together and turn the switch on.
ME.7a.154b.1	ME_7a	2.0	By putting the object on the 2 wires.
ME.7a.155.1	ME_7a	1.0	He can put all the wires together to make a circle and have that run.
ME.7a.173.1	ME_7a	1.0	You can touch those 2 wires together to contract electricity.
ME.7a.174.1	ME_7a	2.0	Lee can put the object in the middle of the wires hanging down. Then you put the wires against the sides of the object.
ME.7a.190.1	ME_7a	0.0	It will work.
ME.7a.195.1	ME_7a	1.0	By putting the wires together.
ME.7a.206.1	ME_7a	0.0	He could get a light bulb and try it out or he could get another battery.
ME.7a.207.1	ME_7a	0.0	You can turn it on.
ME.7a.208.1	ME_7a	1.0	By connecting 2 wires together.
ME.7a.214.1	ME_7a	1.0	He can use the circuit by seeing if the object does anything if it works it is a conductor if it does not then it is an insulator.
ME.7a.215.1	ME_7a	1.0	Connect the 2 wires to a light bulb.
ME.7a.224.1	ME_7a	1.0	He can use the circuit to see if it will start to work.
ME.7a.226.1	ME_7a	0.0	He can put the 2 wires at the bottom of the picture together and the things will start to move.
ME.7a.227.1	ME_7a	1.0	He can use the circuit to test the object because all he needs to do is put the ends of wire together.
ME.7a.228.1	ME_7a	0.0	He can use the circuit to test the object because the circuit will help the thing do what it is supposed to do.
ME.7a.245.1	ME_7a	1.0	He can use it by putting it to an object and see if the meter will run.
ME.7a.247.1	ME_7a	1.0	Start putting the wires on something and see if the motor will go put it to a metal and it might make the motor go.
ME.7a.250.1	ME_7a	2.0	The 2 wires from the switch board and the D-cell. You take the wires and put them up to something and if the motor run it conducts electricity.
ME.7a.251.1	ME_7a	2.0	He can put the 2 wires that are connected to the circuit and put it touching something.
ME.7a.253.1	ME_7a	2.0	You have to put the object between the 2 wires.
ME.7a.254.1	ME_7a	1.0	Lee can test some things on this objects and see if it works.
ME.7a.256.1	ME_7a	0.0	Put it on something metal or a screw or a desk.
ME.7a.278.1	ME_7a	2.0	You can put it between the 2 wires if it makes the motor work but if it does not then it is an insulator.
ME.7a.314.1	ME_7a	1.0	She can put the wire to the other half of the D-cell and the switch and make it work.
ME.7a.318.1	ME_7a	1.0	To run the motor use metal, but fabric will not work on it.
ME.7a.119.1	ME_7a	2.0	He need to connect the wires to the object and see if the motor runs.
ME.7a.178.1	ME_7a	2.0	He will put one part of the wire one side and the other on the other side.
ME.7a.181.1	ME_7a	2.0	He can put the bends of the wire on the material.
ME.7a.277.1	ME_7a	2.0	Connect the object to the wires that do not connect to each other and turn the switch on.
