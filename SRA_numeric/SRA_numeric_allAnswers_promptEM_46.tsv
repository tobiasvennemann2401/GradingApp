EM.46.137.1	EM_46	1.0	It if looks like salt then the salt is salt crystals. If it has lines in them it is calcite crystals.
EM.46.141.1	EM_46	1.0	Calcite is straight lines.
EM.46.147.1	EM_46	2.0	The calcite crystals have lines. Salt crystal have squares.
EM.46.149.1	EM_46	2.0	The calcite crystals were lines and the salt crystals were pyramids and squares.
EM.46.153.1	EM_46	2.0	You can tell them apart because the calcite is just lines. The salt crystals were pyramids and squares.
EM.46.281.1	EM_46	0.0	Calcite look like this the salt, drew picture, crystals look like this, drew picture.
EM.46.284.1	EM_46	1.0	Salt crystals had an X on them and calcite crystals do not.
EM.46.288.1	EM_46	1.0	The salt crystals look like squares.
EM.46.356.1	EM_46	1.0	The salt crystals were square and the calcite had stripes.
EM.46.383.1	EM_46	0.0	When the crystals of the mock rock you could see them really good and with the minerals, calcite, they were hard to see.
EM.46.397.1	EM_46	1.0	I know that crystals are different than salt crystals because the salt crystals do not have needle like structures.
EM.46.399.1	EM_46	0.0	They both have different crystals in them, the ones that are white are whiter than the calcite test crystals.
EM.46.406.1	EM_46	2.0	The calcite crystals looked liked small white needles, the salt crystals were small white globs and squares with Xs and diamonds.
EM.46.409.1	EM_46	0.0	Well the vinegar if you beating a rock it will store bowl.
EM.46.422.1	EM_46	2.0	The crystals were points and the salt crystal were Xs.
EM.46.428.1	EM_46	1.0	The salt crystals have Xs and the others do not.
EM.46.431.1	EM_46	0.0	One of them was whiter than the other and had more crystals.
EM.46.432.1	EM_46	1.0	I can tell the difference because calcite crystals spread out and salt crystals look like squares.
EM.46.433.1	EM_46	1.0	The salt crystals have Xs in them and the other ones look different.
EM.46.491.1	EM_46	0.0	They are different because crystals from the calcite test are not minerals and the salt crystals are minerals.
EM.46.494.1	EM_46	2.0	I can they are different because of their shape calcite crystals look like needles and salt had squares with Xs inside them.
EM.46.508.1	EM_46	0.0	The salt crystals have little Xs and are square shape.
EM.46.523.1	EM_46	0.0	Because the salt crystals were squares with Xs in them and the calcite crystals were and did not make shapes.
EM.46.557.1	EM_46	1.0	The crystals have Xs inside when calcite has like white spot.
EM.46.561.1	EM_46	0.0	The calcite can be white and crystals is black.
EM.46.572.1	EM_46	1.0	Salt crystals had Xs and the crystals did not.
EM.46.576.1	EM_46	0.0	The crystals did not look much like calcite but the did not look like salt either.
EM.46.599.1	EM_46	2.0	Because the crystals from the calcite test were long and skinny. The salt crystals were fat and had designs on.
EM.46.605.1	EM_46	2.0	The calcite crystals had tall needle patterns and the salt crystals were squares with Xs in them.
EM.46.607.1	EM_46	1.0	The difference is the mineral have a little X in the rock have more color.
EM.46.609.1	EM_46	2.0	Because the crystals from calcite look like little needles and the salt crystals had squares with Xs on them.
EM.46.615.1	EM_46	1.0	The one has Xs is the one look like sauce.
EM.46.626.1	EM_46	0.0	Calcite crystals, salt crystals, acid, vinegar.
EM.46.630.1	EM_46	0.0	A crystal is signet, and has stuff in the middle. The calcite is clear smooth. Salt crystals look like something is dried up.
EM.46.634.1	EM_46	1.0	If you have a bowl and inside there is a crystal and you put vinegar in the bowl if it has calcite it will look like needles with salt it will look like yes.
EM.46.649.1	EM_46	1.0	Calcite crystals, long needles. Salt crystals, X shape.
EM.46.171.1	EM_46	1.0	Calcite crystals are flaky and salt crystals were not flaky. They are square instead.
EM.46.185.1	EM_46	1.0	Calcite crystals look different than salt crystals.
EM.46.401.1	EM_46	0.0	The mock rock is smelt like flour but the crystals did not.
EM.46.527.1	EM_46	0.0	Crystals are already there so calcite will leave different crystals behind.
