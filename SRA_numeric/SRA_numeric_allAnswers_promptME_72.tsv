ME.72.106.1	ME_72	2.0	It is the only circuit that will work because the metal is touching the bottom and the wire is touching the bottom of the light.
ME.72.109.1	ME_72	0.0	C because it is on the square part and on the round ball.
ME.72.116.1	ME_72	2.0	It is the only one because the wire is touching the middle and the battery is touching the side.
ME.72.117.1	ME_72	2.0	It is touching all it need to make it to work.
ME.72.122.1	ME_72	2.0	The electricity flows through the plus and the minus to a circle to the light bulb.
ME.72.123.1	ME_72	2.0	Because the light is touching the battery.
ME.72.136.1	ME_72	2.0	The electricity flow in a complete circle.
ME.72.138.1	ME_72	2.0	It is because it is the only one that allows the electricity to go in a complete circuit.
ME.72.145.1	ME_72	0.0	It has to run in a circle.
ME.72.150.1	ME_72	2.0	It is touching both sides of the battery and the light bulb.
ME.72.151.1	ME_72	2.0	Because it is the only one that will form a complete circuit.
ME.72.156.1	ME_72	2.0	The wires have to touch the light bulb so like a circle of air to light up the light bulb.
ME.72.188.1	ME_72	2.0	Because there is a full circuit.
ME.72.194.1	ME_72	1.0	Because the equal part is touching.
ME.72.209.1	ME_72	2.0	The negative and positive are on both parts of the battery.
ME.72.210.1	ME_72	0.0	It will work because the circuit will go through the battery is because the force will go through the battery.
ME.72.211.1	ME_72	2.0	Because D is the only circuit that is touching the black dot.
ME.72.213.1	ME_72	2.0	The wire has to touch both sides of the battery and the wire has to touch the middle of the light bulb.
ME.72.217.1	ME_72	0.0	On the other there is connection with the D-cell with the light.
ME.72.221.1	ME_72	0.0	It is because answer D's wire starts below the light bulb.
ME.72.229.1	ME_72	2.0	The only circuit will work because the 2 wires are put in the right place.
ME.72.242.1	ME_72	2.0	Because they are going in a complete circuit.
ME.72.248.1	ME_72	2.0	Because it is the only one that is touching.
ME.72.255.1	ME_72	1.0	D because it is touching the base metal.
ME.72.279.1	ME_72	2.0	It will work because it is the only one touching the light bulb base.
ME.72.282.1	ME_72	2.0	Because the electricity goes to the metal and that electricity goes to the filament.
ME.72.286.1	ME_72	2.0	Because the others are not complete circuits.
ME.72.315.1	ME_72	0.0	I will work because electricity is going from the positive to the negative.
ME.72.316.1	ME_72	2.0	Why it is the only one is because sometimes you need 2 wires and how it is the only one it is connected to the bottom.
ME.72.321.1	ME_72	2.0	Letter A is the right one because the wire have to touch the equal side and the light bulb.
ME.72.416.1	ME_72	0.0	The charge of the positive negative is flowing to the bulb.
ME.72.418.1	ME_72	2.0	Because the negative is connected to the black part and the positive side is attached to the shiny part.
ME.72.419.1	ME_72	2.0	Because the negative is connected to the black part and the positive side is attached to the shiny part.
ME.72.422.1	ME_72	1.0	Because the white thing is touching the negative side.
ME.72.423.1	ME_72	1.0	Because the shiny part and the wire is touching the black part.
ME.72.426.1	ME_72	0.0	Because one side of the wire is touching the negative side of the D-cell.
ME.72.115.1	ME_72	2.0	One wire needs to be touching the bottom and you can put another wire or battery on the side or the other way around. In this picture a wire is touching the bottom and the D-cell is touching the side.
ME.72.189.1	ME_72	2.0	It is because the wire is touching the right part of the bulb. The electricity is flowing.
ME.72.212.1	ME_72	0.0	The only circuit that will work is A.
ME.72.241.1	ME_72	2.0	The wire is on the D-cell are on the light bulb.
