EM.27b.386.1	EM_27b	1.0	You would see if it bubbles.
EM.27b.391.1	EM_27b	1.0	Bubbles coming out of the rock and murky water.
EM.27b.393.1	EM_27b	1.0	The vinegar would get all full with bubbles, and murky.
EM.27b.403.1	EM_27b	0.0	I would observe broken calcite that looks like wet baby powder.
EM.27b.404.1	EM_27b	0.0	Well a mineral is in a can of rock there is.
EM.27b.409.1	EM_27b	0.0	It would be mostly about minerals.
EM.27b.416.1	EM_27b	1.0	I would see if the rocks bubble.
EM.27b.433.1	EM_27b	1.0	I would observe many bubbles staying on the calcite, and some floating to the top.
EM.27b.436.1	EM_27b	1.0	You would see bubbles.
EM.27b.438.1	EM_27b	1.0	You would look for bubbling.
EM.27b.441.1	EM_27b	1.0	I would look for bubbles if the it has bubble it has calcite.
EM.27b.454.1	EM_27b	2.0	If the rock fizzes it contains calcite because calcite fizzes when put with cold acid.
EM.27b.459.1	EM_27b	2.0	You would see the mineral fizzing.
EM.27b.467.1	EM_27b	1.0	I would notice that it should be bubbling.
EM.27b.487.1	EM_27b	2.0	The rock would be covered by bubbles and fizz.
EM.27b.489.1	EM_27b	1.0	You will see bubbles coming up and you will see them going fast.
EM.27b.494.1	EM_27b	2.0	You would see bubbles fizzing to the top.
EM.27b.501.1	EM_27b	1.0	You would see bubbles floating up or down.
EM.27b.505.1	EM_27b	2.0	The rock would covered by bubbles and fizz.
EM.27b.508.1	EM_27b	2.0	Some parts will fizz and bubble with rise to the top.
EM.27b.509.1	EM_27b	1.0	You would see bubbles rising from the calcite.
EM.27b.525.1	EM_27b	2.0	It would fizz and get small.
EM.27b.530.1	EM_27b	0.0	It would have little tiny crystals that are white.
EM.27b.533.1	EM_27b	0.0	If I in a test on as rock with acid I will put acid on the rock and let it settle overnight.
EM.27b.537.1	EM_27b	2.0	By it fizzing and it might take the rock apart.
EM.27b.541.1	EM_27b	1.0	Bubbly, shiny and kind of see through.
EM.27b.559.1	EM_27b	0.0	Because the one thing that you put vinegar has or has not calcite.
EM.27b.563.1	EM_27b	1.0	For bubbles.
EM.27b.564.1	EM_27b	0.0	Calcite reacts with vinegar.
EM.27b.569.1	EM_27b	0.0	Water breaks rock to little pieces.
EM.27b.574.1	EM_27b	1.0	It will bubble.
EM.27b.606.1	EM_27b	0.0	I would describe what the rocks color is and what the mass if it is a mineral or not.
EM.27b.609.1	EM_27b	2.0	The rock would fizz. If it fizzed then there is calcite in it.
EM.27b.610.1	EM_27b	0.0	It will be separated in groups.
EM.27b.614.1	EM_27b	2.0	You would observe fizz in the rock that contains calcite.
EM.27b.632.1	EM_27b	2.0	It sizzles. If it first sizzles it contains calcite.
EM.27b.420.1	EM_27b	2.0	If you see bubbles coming from the rock it contains calcite.
EM.27b.437.1	EM_27b	2.0	You would observe if the rock or mineral bubbles when you put it in the vinegar.
EM.27b.601.1	EM_27b	2.0	You would observe if it was fizzing because calcite has a strong reaction to vinegar.
EM.27b.638.1	EM_27b	2.0	It would fizzles.
