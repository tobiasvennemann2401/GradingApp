VB.12d.381.1	VB_12d	2.0	The longer the swinger the less swings it makes.
VB.12d.388.1	VB_12d	0.0	How fast the swinger is and how far it has to travel to complete one rotation.
VB.12d.401.1	VB_12d	2.0	The longer the string the less swings or, the shorter the string the more swings.
VB.12d.406.1	VB_12d	2.0	The longer the string the less it swings because it takes longer to swing.
VB.12d.416.1	VB_12d	2.0	The shorter it is it swings more, and the longer it is it swings less.
VB.12d.423.1	VB_12d	2.0	The longer the swinging string is the less times it will swing and when it is a smaller string it goes faster.
VB.12d.431.1	VB_12d	2.0	The shorter the string the faster it swings and the longer the string the slower it swings.
VB.12d.448.1	VB_12d	2.0	The longer the pendulum it will not swing that much.
VB.12d.452.1	VB_12d	1.0	If the swinger is longer, than it has a longer distance to swing.
VB.12d.454.1	VB_12d	2.0	I smaller the string the more amount of numbers.
VB.12d.458.1	VB_12d	2.0	The longer the string the less swings the shorter the more swings.
VB.12d.462.1	VB_12d	2.0	If the string is smaller it swings more times if it is longer it swings less times.
VB.12d.469.1	VB_12d	2.0	The longer the string, the longer the traveling distance so the less times if goes back and forth.
VB.12d.475.1	VB_12d	0.0	The relationship between the string and swinger is that they are different areas and lengths.
VB.12d.477.1	VB_12d	0.0	If you made your string like 25 centimeters long it would probably swing 10 to 12 times because it is sort of long and short.
VB.12d.483.1	VB_12d	2.0	If the string is shorter, it will swing more than if the string is long.
VB.12d.486.1	VB_12d	2.0	If the string is short it goes faster swings a lot more than a long one.
VB.12d.489.1	VB_12d	1.0	The string should be short and it will go faster.
VB.12d.495.1	VB_12d	2.0	If the string is longer it will go slower.
VB.12d.497.1	VB_12d	2.0	The shorter the string the more times it swings.
VB.12d.498.1	VB_12d	2.0	The smaller the string the more the swing. The longer the string less swings.
VB.12d.501.1	VB_12d	0.0	That they both work together.
VB.12d.503.1	VB_12d	2.0	Well if the string is long it swings less times but if it is short it swings more times.
VB.12d.511.1	VB_12d	2.0	If the swinger is smaller it will swing faster if it was longer it will swing slower, If it is really really long it will only swing 5 times.
VB.12d.523.1	VB_12d	0.0	It would make 30 swings in 15 seconds.
VB.12d.525.1	VB_12d	0.0	It can swing 30 seconds and not stop when you swing it.
VB.12d.530.1	VB_12d	2.0	If the string is made shorter it will swing more. If the string is made longer it will swing less.
VB.12d.533.1	VB_12d	2.0	The bigger the length the slower it is the smaller the length is the faster.
VB.12d.535.1	VB_12d	0.0	They each have to be ready to swing.
VB.12d.537.1	VB_12d	1.0	If they made a swinger for like 20 inches it can swing less or high.
VB.12d.539.1	VB_12d	0.0	It changes the number of the swing.
VB.12d.542.1	VB_12d	2.0	Is because the longer the string the shorter of swings.
VB.12d.626.1	VB_12d	2.0	The longer the less swings.
VB.12d.628.1	VB_12d	0.0	In 15 seconds it will swing 12 times.
VB.12d.634.1	VB_12d	2.0	How long the string is how much it got less swings. How short the string is how much it got more swings.
VB.12d.638.1	VB_12d	2.0	The shorter the string the more swings the longer the string the less the swings.
VB.12d.643.1	VB_12d	2.0	The longer the string the less swings The shorter the string the more swings.
VB.12d.394.1	VB_12d	2.0	The longer your string is the less amount of swings you will get.
VB.12d.397.1	VB_12d	1.0	The longer the string the shorter the swings.
VB.12d.440.1	VB_12d	1.0	Well the longer the string the slower it swings so a 90 centimeters swinger will go very slow compared to a 19 centimeters swinger.
VB.12d.636.1	VB_12d	2.0	If the string is short it has more swings but if it is long it has less swings.
