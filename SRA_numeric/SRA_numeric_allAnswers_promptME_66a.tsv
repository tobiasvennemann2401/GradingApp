ME.66a.101.1	ME_66a	1.0	No because a string is not made of iron or steel.
ME.66a.102.1	ME_66a	1.0	It would not work. It would have to be a wire to be able to work because it is not metal.
ME.66a.107.1	ME_66a	2.0	No, because string is not made of metal and it cannot conduct electricity.
ME.66a.108.1	ME_66a	2.0	No because it need to be made of metal to conduct electricity.
ME.66a.111.1	ME_66a	1.0	No because the electricity will not go through the string because it has to be some steel or iron.
ME.66a.113.1	ME_66a	2.0	Because it will not let electricity through the string.
ME.66a.118.1	ME_66a	1.0	No it is not metal.
ME.66a.119.1	ME_66a	2.0	No because a piece of string is not a conductor.
ME.66a.120.1	ME_66a	2.0	No, because Electricity can only go thorough objects that contain metal.
ME.66a.121.1	ME_66a	1.0	No, It has to be a wire to connect. The wire has things in it to connect it.
ME.66a.140.1	ME_66a	2.0	No because string cannot hold the electricity through it.
ME.66a.143.1	ME_66a	2.0	No because it is not metal and it does not allow electricity to get through.
ME.66a.148.1	ME_66a	1.0	No. The string is not made of metal.
ME.66a.153.1	ME_66a	2.0	You cannot because a piece of string is not steel metal or iron so it cannot go through.
ME.66a.155.1	ME_66a	1.0	You could not do that because the circuit would not make it.
ME.66a.159.1	ME_66a	1.0	No, because it is made of thread.
ME.66a.173.1	ME_66a	1.0	No because the string had not metal or iron.
ME.66a.174.1	ME_66a	1.0	No, it will not work because you have to have some kind of metal to make it work.
ME.66a.178.1	ME_66a	1.0	No it has to hook up to the D-cell.
ME.66a.181.1	ME_66a	2.0	You cannot because it is an insulator.
ME.66a.183.1	ME_66a	2.0	No, because electricity does not flow through string.
ME.66a.191.1	ME_66a	2.0	It could not because electricity cannot go through sting.
ME.66a.208.1	ME_66a	2.0	No, because a piece of string does not have electricity in it.
ME.66a.216.1	ME_66a	1.0	No! You need another wire to connection.
ME.66a.225.1	ME_66a	2.0	No, because it needs a path of electricity. It would need a wire.
ME.66a.227.1	ME_66a	1.0	No, because it does not have a wire and it cannot get energy.
ME.66a.228.1	ME_66a	2.0	No because a piece of string is not something made of wire and cannot carry electricity through that type of material.
ME.66a.245.1	ME_66a	1.0	No, because it does not have any metal.
ME.66a.247.1	ME_66a	0.0	Yes and why is that up put in the 2 holes and the you can make electricity.
ME.66a.250.1	ME_66a	2.0	No, because the electricity cannot flow through the yarn.
ME.66a.251.1	ME_66a	2.0	No, you cannot. That is because it does not conduct electricity.
ME.66a.253.1	ME_66a	1.0	No because you need to have a aluminum foil.
ME.66a.278.1	ME_66a	2.0	You cannot use a piece of string because it has no electricity in it.
ME.66a.292.1	ME_66a	1.0	No because it is a String.
ME.66a.293.1	ME_66a	1.0	No because the string is not a wire.
ME.66a.323.1	ME_66a	2.0	You cannot use a piece of string to make a connection because only aluminum, iron, steel and brass can.
ME.66a.146.1	ME_66a	1.0	The string does not have iron in it to make it work.
ME.66a.147.1	ME_66a	0.0	Because it is not going in a circle so it will not work.
ME.66a.313.1	ME_66a	0.0	You can use string because it will hook and make it work.
ME.66a.329.1	ME_66a	0.0	Why it does work, because if the string is together the motor will run.
