FN.26b.119.1	FN_26b	1.0	The evidence is that OJ1 has a higher dot.
FN.26b.121.1	FN_26b	1.0	The evidence is that it has more in the syringe.
FN.26b.123.1	FN_26b	0.0	The evidence is carbon dioxide.
FN.26b.139.1	FN_26b	2.0	OJ1 has more acid because the dot is higher than OJ2's dot.
FN.26b.148.1	FN_26b	1.0	The little siky dot on OJ1 is higher than OJ2.
FN.26b.151.1	FN_26b	2.0	The plunger went higher which means there is more acid.
FN.26b.154.1	FN_26b	1.0	The evidence was that OJ1 was higher than OJ2.
FN.26b.157.1	FN_26b	2.0	Because the acid made OJ1 go up higher than the OJ2 in the tube.
FN.26b.160.1	FN_26b	2.0	Because OJ1 is higher up than OJ2 so that means it has more acid.
FN.26b.161.1	FN_26b	0.0	The evidence is that water has a higher concentration of acid.
FN.26b.171.1	FN_26b	1.0	OJ1 has a little bit more than 0.5. OJ2 is less than OJ1 and has about 0.5 or in between 0.25 and 0.5 of orange juice added.
FN.26b.188.1	FN_26b	1.0	It is higher than OJ2.
FN.26b.213.1	FN_26b	2.0	OJ1 has more acid because it has more amount of gas in the syringes. The more the gas the more acid it has.
FN.26b.219.1	FN_26b	1.0	That the more carbon dioxide means that it is an acid.
FN.26b.221.1	FN_26b	1.0	Because the acid in carbon dioxide was higher than the carbon dioxide of OJ2.
FN.26b.223.1	FN_26b	0.0	Its little meter.
FN.26b.224.1	FN_26b	1.0	If you look on the chart the dot is higher, so it has more vitamin C.
FN.26b.226.1	FN_26b	2.0	OJ1's syringe filled up with carbon dioxide more than OJ2 did, making OJ1 have more acid.
FN.26b.230.1	FN_26b	2.0	The evidence is that OJ1 has more acid because it is higher.
FN.26b.247.1	FN_26b	1.0	OJ1 because it went higher on the picture.
FN.26b.257.1	FN_26b	1.0	It had more fizz and pressure.
FN.26b.262.1	FN_26b	1.0	I know this because OJ1 is higher than OJ2 is.
FN.26b.264.1	FN_26b	1.0	The evidence is that if it is higher it has more gas the lower the less gas.
FN.26b.267.1	FN_26b	2.0	There is more gas in the syringes.
FN.26b.290.1	FN_26b	1.0	OJ1 has more than 0.5 but OJ2 has a little more than 0.25.
FN.26b.294.1	FN_26b	1.0	OJ1 is more than 0.5 full but OJ2 is less than 0.5 full.
FN.26b.306.1	FN_26b	1.0	The evidence is that the syringe will pop up, whatever number it lands on that is how much acid it contains.
FN.26b.311.1	FN_26b	1.0	OJ1 is on the 0.5 and OJ2 is in between the 0.5 and the 0.25.
FN.26b.313.1	FN_26b	0.0	Because OJ1 has a more amount of acid.
FN.26b.323.1	FN_26b	1.0	It is higher.
FN.26b.324.1	FN_26b	1.0	The syringe on OJ1 rose higher than on OJ2.
FN.26b.326.1	FN_26b	1.0	The syringes in the OJ2 has less gas and the OJ1 is higher in OJ1.
FN.26b.328.1	FN_26b	0.0	Because it reacted the most.
FN.26b.330.1	FN_26b	2.0	The syringe that contains more gas indicates that it has more acid.
FN.26b.337.1	FN_26b	1.0	OJ1 was above 0.5 and OJ2 was in between 0.25 to 0.5.
FN.26b.338.1	FN_26b	1.0	The OJ1 has a marker in a higher spot than OJ2 which means OJ1 produced more gas than OJ2.
FN.26b.348.1	FN_26b	1.0	The evidence is the syringe went higher up with OJ1 than with OJ2.
FN.26b.351.1	FN_26b	1.0	The evidence is the OJ1 has more vitamin C in it.
FN.26b.364.1	FN_26b	0.0	Which juice has a higher concentration of acid.
