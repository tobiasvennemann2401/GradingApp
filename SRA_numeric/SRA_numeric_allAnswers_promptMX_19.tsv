MX.19.387.1	MX_19	1.0	Because when it fizzing it releases a gas. When a gas forms from 2 materials it is a gas.
MX.19.390.1	MX_19	0.0	Because the baking soda and citric acid started out plain but when you poured water in it reacted.
MX.19.392.1	MX_19	0.0	Because it shows and once you see it you will know that it is a chemical reaction because it starts to look like little bubbles and that is what a chemical reaction is.
MX.19.423.1	MX_19	2.0	Because it indicates something else is produced.
MX.19.425.1	MX_19	0.0	Because the chemicals clash and fizz.
MX.19.426.1	MX_19	2.0	Because It means that it is a gas or new material!
MX.19.432.1	MX_19	2.0	It created a gas and new material was made.
MX.19.438.1	MX_19	1.0	Because the 2 solutes and the solvent made a gas.
MX.19.439.1	MX_19	2.0	It indicates a gas.
MX.19.453.1	MX_19	0.0	Because the bubble makes the solution or mixture different.
MX.19.454.1	MX_19	1.0	Because it was letting out gas.
MX.19.459.1	MX_19	1.0	Gas was in it so that why it start fizzing.
MX.19.463.1	MX_19	2.0	It is a clue because it is making a gas and that is a clue so you know that a chemical reaction is about to happen.
MX.19.464.1	MX_19	1.0	Because you made a gas.
MX.19.467.1	MX_19	2.0	Because a chemical reaction creates gas bubbles or a precipitate.
MX.19.469.1	MX_19	1.0	It was fizzing because when he a mix baking soda and citric acid together the fizzing have meant that it dissolved and made bubbles.
MX.19.473.1	MX_19	0.0	Because it shows that something other than just doing nothing.
MX.19.487.1	MX_19	2.0	Because something has to happen for the precipitate to be made.
MX.19.492.1	MX_19	0.0	Because fizzing is created by gas bubbles.
MX.19.494.1	MX_19	2.0	Because fizzing is a sign of gas leaving a material and that is a chemical reaction.
MX.19.496.1	MX_19	2.0	Because when it does that you know that you have made gasses and gasses are made when chemical reactions occur.
MX.19.500.1	MX_19	0.0	Fizzing is a reaction.
MX.19.501.1	MX_19	2.0	Sometimes because fizzing means that gas is escaping and that is a chemical reaction.
MX.19.502.1	MX_19	0.0	Because if it was just water it would not fizz.
MX.19.560.1	MX_19	2.0	Because when it fizzes there is gas and that is a sign of a chemical reaction.
MX.19.563.1	MX_19	2.0	It is evidence because it made gas and fizzing occurs only when one material does not like the other one.
MX.19.564.1	MX_19	2.0	Fizzing evidence of a chemical reaction because when it fizzes it means it is producing gas.
MX.19.575.1	MX_19	2.0	It is a chemical reaction because it made a gas and a gas only appears if there is a chemical reaction.
MX.19.595.1	MX_19	0.0	Something happened so it is a reaction.
MX.19.597.1	MX_19	0.0	Because fizzing is a reaction and so it had to be a chemical reaction.
MX.19.604.1	MX_19	0.0	Because you are putting 2 mixtures together so when it starts fizzing that is how you know it is a chemical reaction.
MX.19.605.1	MX_19	0.0	Because it did something.
MX.19.608.1	MX_19	0.0	Because it fizzed and moved so that is how.
MX.19.612.1	MX_19	0.0	Because it is bubbling and bubbling is a reaction when you mix stuff together and it bubbles.
MX.19.626.1	MX_19	0.0	Because when more than 2 chemicals are mixed it produces fizzing.
MX.19.635.1	MX_19	0.0	Because the material before did not use to fizz until they were put together.
MX.19.381.1	MX_19	1.0	A gas is being formed causing it to bubble.
MX.19.396.1	MX_19	2.0	Fizzing usually means bubbles. And bubbles mean there was gas formed which is a sign of a chemical reaction so yes.
MX.19.504.1	MX_19	1.0	The bubbles occurred because it was gas.
MX.19.540.1	MX_19	0.0	Probably.
