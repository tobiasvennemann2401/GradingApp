MX.24.384.1	MX_24	1.0	Because it turns clear. It bubbles.
MX.24.388.1	MX_24	2.0	When you can see through the solution. When the solid gets dissolved into the liquid.
MX.24.389.1	MX_24	1.0	When you mix a solid and a liquid it is clear.
MX.24.390.1	MX_24	1.0	Because the mixture is clear.
MX.24.393.1	MX_24	1.0	It is clear and can be separated with evaporation.
MX.24.394.1	MX_24	2.0	You can see through the mixture, and one material has dissolved.
MX.24.400.1	MX_24	2.0	When one seems to disappear because it has dissolved, and you can see through it.
MX.24.433.1	MX_24	0.0	When it creates one type of something. Like chocolate milk.
MX.24.435.1	MX_24	2.0	It is when you cannot see the solid from the liquid.
MX.24.438.1	MX_24	1.0	When you cannot separate them with filters or screens.
MX.24.455.1	MX_24	1.0	The solid seems to disappear, or dissolve.
MX.24.465.1	MX_24	0.0	Well I will see the solid at the bottom and the liquid on top of it.
MX.24.466.1	MX_24	1.0	You know because the solid matrix I will dissolve overnight.
MX.24.467.1	MX_24	1.0	Then material will probably split up into smaller parts.
MX.24.469.1	MX_24	0.0	Because the solid is kind of hard and liquid is more smoother.
MX.24.470.1	MX_24	1.0	When you cannot see the solid.
MX.24.495.1	MX_24	2.0	The solid dissolves. The solid breaks into tiny pieces so tiny no one can see it.
MX.24.497.1	MX_24	0.0	If you experiment you might find a way to separate.
MX.24.499.1	MX_24	1.0	Of the materials dissolve.
MX.24.563.1	MX_24	1.0	You know when the solid is dissolved.
MX.24.573.1	MX_24	2.0	When water and salt mix the salt disappears or seems to and when you cannot see the salt that means you have made a solution.
MX.24.576.1	MX_24	2.0	The solid disappears into air pockets.
MX.24.593.1	MX_24	0.0	When something is mixing so you get a solution.
MX.24.598.1	MX_24	0.0	You see how it mixes together and sometimes there are bubbles or wet.
MX.24.600.1	MX_24	1.0	It is clear.
MX.24.601.1	MX_24	0.0	I know that because it is mixed up because it is not clear anymore.
MX.24.608.1	MX_24	0.0	When the water turns gray or a different color.
MX.24.610.1	MX_24	0.0	Powder and water when they mix together. The water turn white, that how you tell or you look to the bottom.
MX.24.613.1	MX_24	0.0	When they are in the container the water brushes off some dirt from the solid.
MX.24.629.1	MX_24	1.0	When the solid dissolves.
MX.24.638.1	MX_24	1.0	Because one of the chemicals dissolves.
MX.24.418.1	MX_24	2.0	Because you can see through it, and the mixture will dissolve into it.
MX.24.468.1	MX_24	1.0	You can not see the solid no more because it is going and you cannot see the solution.
MX.24.527.1	MX_24	1.0	You know when the solid cannot be seen.
MX.24.566.1	MX_24	1.0	When the solid dissolves into the liquid.
