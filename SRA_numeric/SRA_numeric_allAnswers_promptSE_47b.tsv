SE.47b.117.1	SE_47b	2.0	Why I chose the dark green sheeting was because the darker color absorbs heat.
SE.47b.150.1	SE_47b	1.0	It is darker and it will probably heat faster.
SE.47b.151.1	SE_47b	2.0	Because dark green is a dark color like black that way dark green absorbs more heat.
SE.47b.157.1	SE_47b	2.0	Because if you put dark green, it will absorb the heat from the sun fast, because it is a dark color.
SE.47b.165.1	SE_47b	1.0	She should use the dark green because it will absorb more heat.
SE.47b.192.1	SE_47b	0.0	When they put a piece of plastic bag on the bottom it will heat up a little bit.
SE.47b.247.1	SE_47b	1.0	The darker the color the faster it would heat up.
SE.47b.265.1	SE_47b	1.0	Because it is dark green and dark colors heat faster than light colors.
SE.47b.331.1	SE_47b	2.0	The green is almost like black and the darker the sheeting is its color attracts the sun and heats up the pool.
SE.47b.332.1	SE_47b	1.0	I chose that one because the sun might reflect it back and almost every dark color are the ones who makes it hot.
SE.47b.335.1	SE_47b	1.0	I pick B because I think it is ok alright.
SE.47b.384.1	SE_47b	1.0	Because the dark green will absorb the heat.
SE.47b.386.1	SE_47b	2.0	If she uses dark plastic the water will heat up more quickly.
SE.47b.388.1	SE_47b	2.0	Because dark green absorbs heat and yellow reflects heat.
SE.47b.418.1	SE_47b	1.0	Because the darker plastic will absorb the heat and it will heat the pool faster.
SE.47b.419.1	SE_47b	2.0	I chose dark green because dark colors attract the sun.
SE.47b.493.1	SE_47b	1.0	Because the color black or dark colors will absorb the heat then transfer it to the water.
SE.47b.494.1	SE_47b	2.0	I chose to put the green plastic because if the color is dark then the sun gets attracted to the dark color which makes it heat up faster.
SE.47b.497.1	SE_47b	2.0	I choose B because if you use a light color the solar energy will reflect off it if you use a dark color it will absorb the solar energy.
SE.47b.499.1	SE_47b	1.0	Darker colors will heat up faster.
SE.47b.502.1	SE_47b	2.0	I chose B because dark green is the darkest color and dark colors absorbs the sun's energy.
SE.47b.505.1	SE_47b	1.0	Because dark colors absorb heat and energy.
SE.47b.507.1	SE_47b	1.0	Because dark colors absorb the heat, and light colors do not. They reflect them.
SE.47b.508.1	SE_47b	0.0	Because yellow is a light color and would reflect the sun's energy.
SE.47b.510.1	SE_47b	1.0	I chose that answer because yellow reflects heat and dark stuff keep heat.
SE.47b.513.1	SE_47b	2.0	Because when you have a dark color it absorbs more of the heat, so that is why Sue should put dark green at the bottom of the pool.
SE.47b.514.1	SE_47b	1.0	The darker the plastic the quicker the water will heat up.
SE.47b.515.1	SE_47b	1.0	Dark green is a darker color than yellow, therefore it will heat hotter and faster.
SE.47b.521.1	SE_47b	1.0	I chose it because dark green is darker than yellow, and because the green absorbs heat and yellow reflects.
SE.47b.527.1	SE_47b	0.0	A dark color can be reflected by the sun and it could heat up the wading pool's water.
SE.47b.530.1	SE_47b	1.0	Because dark color absorbs more sunlight.
SE.47b.536.1	SE_47b	2.0	Dark green because darker colors heat faster they attract the sun.
SE.47b.547.1	SE_47b	1.0	Because it is darker than yellow so it might attract to the sun to make the pool hotter.
SE.47b.558.1	SE_47b	1.0	Because heat is absorbed by dark colors.
SE.47b.572.1	SE_47b	1.0	Because the darker the color the faster it will heat up.
SE.47b.613.1	SE_47b	1.0	Anything that is dark could be just like black.
SE.47b.132.1	SE_47b	2.0	Because the darker the color the hotter it gets.
SE.47b.490.1	SE_47b	2.0	I chose this answer because dark green is a darker color and would heat faster.
SE.47b.532.1	SE_47b	2.0	Because darker colors heat up faster.
SE.47b.538.1	SE_47b	2.0	Because the darkest color available would transfer from absorbing the heat from the dark green.
