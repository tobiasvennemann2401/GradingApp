MX.47b.381.1	MX_47b	2.0	If you take the same amount of water and weight it will measure to the same things.
MX.47b.385.1	MX_47b	0.0	I chose cup 2 because it has the same water 2 has more solute.
MX.47b.386.1	MX_47b	2.0	The solutions have the same amount of solute, there is just more on the bottom of the cup in cup 2.
MX.47b.388.1	MX_47b	2.0	I chose A because in each cup you could put 4 spoons and it dissolved. When the fifth scoop went in it did not dissolve. The undissolved part is not part of the solution.
MX.47b.418.1	MX_47b	1.0	Once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.
MX.47b.421.1	MX_47b	2.0	My choice is A because it might weigh the same and they both is saturated.
MX.47b.422.1	MX_47b	2.0	Because both of the cups one and 2 have the same amount of concentrations because they are both saturated.
MX.47b.423.1	MX_47b	2.0	They are the same because once a solution is saturated it cannot go further.
MX.47b.425.1	MX_47b	0.0	I chose cup 2 because it has more solute in it.
MX.47b.426.1	MX_47b	0.0	I picked C because cup 2 has more solute than cup one.
MX.47b.434.1	MX_47b	0.0	Because it has more spoons of solute but it has the same amount of water.
MX.47b.453.1	MX_47b	0.0	Because there is the same amount of solvent but there is more solute in cup 2.
MX.47b.455.1	MX_47b	2.0	Each solution has same amount of water, which means they both hold the same amount of solute after saturation.
MX.47b.457.1	MX_47b	2.0	Because they are both at the highest point of concentration.
MX.47b.460.1	MX_47b	1.0	Because it is the same.
MX.47b.462.1	MX_47b	0.0	It does not show how much dissolved and how much did not.
MX.47b.488.1	MX_47b	1.0	Because both cup one and 2 are already concentrated. Neither cup one or 2 can hold any more solvent.
MX.47b.498.1	MX_47b	1.0	Because Tabby said that the solute and water were the same and I believe him and it says that they both have the same thing on the bottom clear, material on the bottom.
MX.47b.504.1	MX_47b	0.0	It clearly states that 2 has more.
MX.47b.524.1	MX_47b	0.0	Because is look like it.
MX.47b.531.1	MX_47b	0.0	Same water but more scoops.
MX.47b.532.1	MX_47b	1.0	Because both looked alike to me.
MX.47b.540.1	MX_47b	0.0	Because cup 2 have 8 spoons.
MX.47b.541.1	MX_47b	0.0	I think that the answer is cup 2 because it has more spoons.
MX.47b.556.1	MX_47b	0.0	Because solution 2 is more concentrate because it has more spoonfuls.
MX.47b.563.1	MX_47b	0.0	I put C because cup 2 has more spoons of solute so it would be heavier.
MX.47b.567.1	MX_47b	0.0	Because cup 2 has more salt, 8 spoons and because it has more material on the bottom.
MX.47b.571.1	MX_47b	1.0	I put A because it is the same because it the same amount of water and only 2 scoops more than the other one.
MX.47b.595.1	MX_47b	0.0	I would need to know how much stuff is at the bottom.
MX.47b.597.1	MX_47b	0.0	Because they have the same amount of water but cup 2 has more spoons of solute.
MX.47b.598.1	MX_47b	1.0	Both have the same because they have the same milliliters of water and they are both the same.
MX.47b.604.1	MX_47b	1.0	Cup one might have 6 spoons of solute and cup 2 has 8 spoons and both have 50 milliliters of water.
MX.47b.635.1	MX_47b	0.0	Cup one has less material on the bottom.
MX.47b.638.1	MX_47b	0.0	Because cup one has the same amount of water but different amount of solute.
MX.47b.640.1	MX_47b	0.0	The solutions both have the same amount of water, but not the same amount of clear material on the bottom. So cup one wins.
MX.47b.641.1	MX_47b	2.0	Because both are saturated, and if you used 6 spoons for cup 2 both cups are still saturated.
MX.47b.456.1	MX_47b	2.0	Cup 2 has more material on the bottom than cup one. So cup one might one scoop saturated and cup 2 might have 3 scoops on the bottom but the same concentration in the solution.
MX.47b.493.1	MX_47b	0.0	Because cup A have more solute then cup one. But they have the same amount of water.
MX.47b.528.1	MX_47b	0.0	I chose C because it has 8 spoons solute.
MX.47b.575.1	MX_47b	2.0	Once saturated it is at the most concentration it can get, and they are both saturated.
