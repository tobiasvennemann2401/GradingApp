VB.29.381.1	VB_29	0.0	You have a standard because if you do not it will not be controlled.
VB.29.384.1	VB_29	2.0	So that you can see the results of an experiment before a variable is changed so you can compare.
VB.29.388.1	VB_29	1.0	You use a standard so you will not make a mistake and so you can compare it to differences.
VB.29.394.1	VB_29	2.0	You start with a standard so you can compare your standard data to your data when you change a variable.
VB.29.397.1	VB_29	0.0	So you can get the closest answer to the question.
VB.29.399.1	VB_29	0.0	So you can record and change variables to get a difference.
VB.29.404.1	VB_29	2.0	So that control your experiment without changing more than one variable.
VB.29.407.1	VB_29	0.0	To keep the variables controlled.
VB.29.416.1	VB_29	2.0	You use a standard so you can tell what happened in a controlled experiment and because you can change one variable at a time.
VB.29.419.1	VB_29	2.0	You would use a standard to change any variables than just one variable that can be changed.
VB.29.423.1	VB_29	1.0	You use a standard to control your procedure, like if you get it wrong you can see what you did.
VB.29.440.1	VB_29	1.0	To compare the new experiment with the standard.
VB.29.444.1	VB_29	2.0	You use a standard because when you change something which is a variable. That when you change it, you know when you did before.
VB.29.448.1	VB_29	1.0	You use a standard because without a standard, you can change it.
VB.29.452.1	VB_29	1.0	So you can see what you did after you do the other trials, it makes a controlled experiment to look back on when you change one variable at a time.
VB.29.454.1	VB_29	2.0	You use a standard to see if you can try a less amount each time you do an experiment.
VB.29.458.1	VB_29	1.0	You use a standard so that you can test it and compare with your standard. And compare with your variable.
VB.29.466.1	VB_29	2.0	When conducting a controlled experiment you use a standard because you compare your other results to see if it is accurate.
VB.29.475.1	VB_29	1.0	You use a standard so you can change the variable if needed in an experiment and you can also change the variable at a time.
VB.29.477.1	VB_29	0.0	You use a standard because that what you know before the experiment and the standard helps you a lot during the experiment.
VB.29.481.1	VB_29	1.0	In a controlled experiment you use a standard because when you are testing something else you will have to compare your answers. That is where a standard comes in.
VB.29.486.1	VB_29	0.0	To compare your answers.
VB.29.489.1	VB_29	1.0	We use a standard first because we could know how it went then we could use the score it went and test it again.
VB.29.495.1	VB_29	0.0	You use a standard is to know what you will do and how it will happen.
VB.29.497.1	VB_29	1.0	So when you change variables you can compare you standard and the other ones.
VB.29.501.1	VB_29	1.0	So you can test the standard and can switch one variable to make it proven.
VB.29.503.1	VB_29	1.0	Because you want to know what is the regular way and to compare the first way.
VB.29.523.1	VB_29	1.0	So you can compare your answers.
VB.29.525.1	VB_29	1.0	To compare the experiment with the standard one.
VB.29.530.1	VB_29	1.0	So when you are done you could compare.
VB.29.533.1	VB_29	1.0	So you compare at the end of the experiment.
VB.29.537.1	VB_29	1.0	To see if the standard might be faster than the other.
VB.29.542.1	VB_29	1.0	Because you can compare the results.
VB.29.626.1	VB_29	0.0	To help control the controlled experiment.
VB.29.628.1	VB_29	0.0	To control any experiment.
VB.29.634.1	VB_29	0.0	Because without a standard you will not know the steps.
VB.29.429.1	VB_29	0.0	In a controlled experiment.
VB.29.432.1	VB_29	1.0	You need to have a standard so you can tell the difference of what the experiment was and so you can tell how far it went.
VB.29.462.1	VB_29	1.0	You use a standard because you know it will be controlled if you do something random it might not work and that is not a controlled experiment.
VB.29.511.1	VB_29	0.0	So when you start with the standard it will help you understand more of the experiment.
