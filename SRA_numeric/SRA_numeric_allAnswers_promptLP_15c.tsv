LP.15c.105.1	LP_15c	0.0	They both relate because one equals the other for a answer.
LP.15c.107.1	LP_15c	0.0	They both help the scale by weighing the load.
LP.15c.111.1	LP_15c	2.0	The farther away the effort is the easier it is to lift the load.
LP.15c.112.1	LP_15c	0.0	Its distance 15 centimeters.
LP.15c.183.1	LP_15c	2.0	The further the effort, the less effort is needed. The closer the effort, the more is needed.
LP.15c.188.1	LP_15c	2.0	The farther away from the fulcrum the less effort is needed and the closer to the fulcrum the more effort.
LP.15c.208.1	LP_15c	0.0	The closer the effort is to the fulcrum, the harder it is to lift the load.
LP.15c.290.1	LP_15c	0.0	Joule equals force times distance.
LP.15c.389.1	LP_15c	2.0	The closer the effort is to the fulcrum the more effort it would take but the further the effort would not be as much.
LP.15c.452.1	LP_15c	1.0	When the effort gets farther away from the load the weight of the effort decreases.
LP.15c.455.1	LP_15c	2.0	When effort far from the fulcrum the load gets lighter.
LP.15c.456.1	LP_15c	2.0	The farther away the effort is from the fulcrum the greater advantage you get.
LP.15c.461.1	LP_15c	0.0	The further the fulcrum lever is, closer it is the less it weighs.
LP.15c.463.1	LP_15c	2.0	The farther it is the easier it is.
LP.15c.486.1	LP_15c	0.0	When you move the effort further away the effort increases, when you move it in the effort decreases.
LP.15c.487.1	LP_15c	2.0	As you move out it is easier.
LP.15c.488.1	LP_15c	2.0	The relationship between the amount of effort required and its distance from the fulcrum is as the effort increased distance from the fulcrum the effort needed decreased.
LP.15c.491.1	LP_15c	2.0	The farther the effort is from the fulcrum the less effort is needed.
LP.15c.492.1	LP_15c	2.0	The farther away from the fulcrum the effort decreases.
LP.15c.495.1	LP_15c	0.0	Instead of going it went down.
LP.15c.501.1	LP_15c	0.0	Can be use of the amount to lift the load and to adjust the lever and load.
LP.15c.502.1	LP_15c	0.0	The closer the scale more effort is needed to lift the load.
LP.15c.523.1	LP_15c	2.0	As the effort gets farther from the fulcrum it is easier to lift the load.
LP.15c.524.1	LP_15c	2.0	The farther away from the fulcrum less effort is needed.
LP.15c.534.1	LP_15c	0.0	The relationship is the farther over the effort is the harder it is to lift.
LP.15c.538.1	LP_15c	0.0	It is easier to lift when the load is closer to the fulcrum.
LP.15c.571.1	LP_15c	0.0	The closer the load is to the fulcrum the less Newtons. The farther away from the fulcrum the load is the more Newtons.
LP.15c.573.1	LP_15c	2.0	The farther away the effort is from the fulcrum the less effort it takes. The closer the effort is to the fulcrum the more effort it takes.
LP.15c.575.1	LP_15c	0.0	It is harder to lift when the load is far from the load.
LP.15c.601.1	LP_15c	2.0	The distance matters in this experiment. The closer the effort is to the fulcrum, the more effort it takes to lift the fulcrum.
LP.15c.603.1	LP_15c	0.0	When the load is closer to the fulcrum it is easier to lift.
LP.15c.604.1	LP_15c	2.0	The farther away the effort is from the fulcrum the easier it is to lift the load.
LP.15c.608.1	LP_15c	2.0	The further away the effort is from the fulcrum the easier it is to pull.
LP.15c.631.1	LP_15c	0.0	It takes more effort the farther away the load is from the fulcrum.
LP.15c.634.1	LP_15c	2.0	When it was closer it was harder and when it was farther away it was easier.
LP.15c.636.1	LP_15c	0.0	If the fulcrum is too close to the effort or the other way around it is harder. Same thing with the fulcrum and the load. It is harder to move it.
LP.15c.145.1	LP_15c	0.0	They both start off with 0. And they both have effort in it.
LP.15c.171.1	LP_15c	2.0	If the effort is farther from the fulcrum, it takes less effort to lift it.
LP.15c.425.1	LP_15c	2.0	The farther the effort is applied from the fulcrum the effort decreases.
LP.15c.630.1	LP_15c	0.0	If the effort is closer to the fulcrum then it is easier but if the effort is farther from the fulcrum then it is harder.
