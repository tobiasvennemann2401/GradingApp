MX.18.106.1	MX_18	0.0	It dissolved in the water.
MX.18.119.1	MX_18	0.0	The chemical that stayed down there.
MX.18.146.1	MX_18	0.0	The chemical that saturated down there.
MX.18.151.1	MX_18	0.0	That is not a solution it is a mixture.
MX.18.219.1	MX_18	1.0	It creates a precipitate a new chemical who you mix 2 different chemicals and that creates a precipitate.
MX.18.248.1	MX_18	0.0	The white solid indicates by being a mixture.
MX.18.255.1	MX_18	0.0	The white solid indicates that the white solid went to the bottom.
MX.18.277.1	MX_18	0.0	A solution.
MX.18.283.1	MX_18	0.0	To evaporate.
MX.18.291.1	MX_18	0.0	The material that you put in the water did not dissolve because it is too heavy.
MX.18.364.1	MX_18	0.0	The white solid had settles and so the 2 solutions would be a mixture.
MX.18.366.1	MX_18	0.0	All of the thing that you put in will go to the bottom leaving a clear liquid.
MX.18.381.1	MX_18	1.0	There is a precipitate on the bottom.
MX.18.387.1	MX_18	0.0	It is a product on the bottom of the cap.
MX.18.422.1	MX_18	1.0	Well when you mix the 2 solutions it became a different mixture.
MX.18.426.1	MX_18	1.0	That it is a new solid material.
MX.18.428.1	MX_18	2.0	Chemical reaction.
MX.18.439.1	MX_18	2.0	A chemical reaction.
MX.18.453.1	MX_18	1.0	It indicates a precipitate.
MX.18.456.1	MX_18	1.0	That white solid indicates a precipitate.
MX.18.458.1	MX_18	0.0	It saturated in the cup.
MX.18.463.1	MX_18	1.0	That it is a precipitate because if they mixed materials, together and there was a cherry and there is a new material then that is a precipitate.
MX.18.468.1	MX_18	0.0	Because that one that you are say that you are so to 46 that or no.
MX.18.490.1	MX_18	0.0	That the water cannot hold any more solute. It is saturated.
MX.18.492.1	MX_18	0.0	That the white solid is C.
MX.18.493.1	MX_18	1.0	A new product that is called a precipitate.
MX.18.496.1	MX_18	0.0	That you have made a saturated solution.
MX.18.503.1	MX_18	1.0	The white solid indicates that a precipitate has occurred.
MX.18.504.1	MX_18	1.0	A precipitant.
MX.18.542.1	MX_18	0.0	Salt.
MX.18.572.1	MX_18	0.0	It was solution and a mixture. It promptly got cold or hot at the bottom.
