ME.17e.101.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes because there is enough power for it to work but it will be bright and it is a parallel circuit.
ME.17e.102.1	ME_17e	2.0	No she cannot. Why is because she only has one switch and she has to have 2 for both to work.
ME.17e.105.1	ME_17e	1.0	No. She cannot because the switch has to be in front of the negative sign.
ME.17e.107.1	ME_17e	2.0	No, because the switch can only complete one circuit at a time.
ME.17e.108.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes. Because it is a parallel circuit and they can both run well.
ME.17e.115.1	ME_17e	2.0	No. The switch can only be hooked on one side at one time, unless you scooted the wires to the middle and hooked them up together.
ME.17e.118.1	ME_17e	2.0	No, It is not a complete circuit.
ME.17e.119.1	ME_17e	1.0	No because she need a wire and a switch.
ME.17e.120.1	ME_17e	2.0	No, she cannot because the switch can only go one way and make a complete circuit.
ME.17e.121.1	ME_17e	2.0	No! The switch cannot be left and right at the same time.
ME.17e.123.1	ME_17e	1.0	No she cannot. She would have to turn the switch like this sideways Because there is a gap if you turn it left or right.
ME.17e.141.1	ME_17e	1.0	No because the negative on the side for the bulb might have to have the energy from the motor going in and it will go back and forth.
ME.17e.142.1	ME_17e	1.0	No because the light bulb will flicker and the motor will keep going until she turns the switch off.
ME.17e.143.1	ME_17e	2.0	No because it cannot make a complete circuit going each way.
ME.17e.144.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes because the motor is sending the energy back to the light bulb and back.
ME.17e.152.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes. She could put 2 wires on the switch to the other wires.
ME.17e.173.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes because the battery has enough power to run both unless the switch is on.
ME.17e.176.1	ME_17e	2.0	No because the switch cannot go 2 ways at once.
ME.17e.178.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes. But all will have to be together.
ME.17e.179.1	ME_17e	1.0	No she cannot because she only has one switch.
ME.17e.180.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes because all she has to do is put the motor and the light bulb on the same wire and put the switch in the middle.
ME.17e.181.1	ME_17e	0.0	She can do it but it would have to be a parallel circuit.
ME.17e.183.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes, we all tried it in class and it worked.
ME.17e.191.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes, because the wires are connected to both items.
ME.17e.192.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes she can because the flow will go all the way to the source.
ME.17e.193.1	ME_17e	0.0	Well she could try the light would not work as strong as the motor.
ME.17e.206.1	ME_17e	1.0	No she would need 2 switches.
ME.17e.208.1	ME_17e	1.0	No, she would have to have 2 switches.
ME.17e.214.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes, because the flow of electricity will go to the light and then to the motor.
ME.17e.216.1	ME_17e	2.0	No because she can only turn the switch to the light bulb or the motor.
ME.17e.245.1	ME_17e	2.0	No, because there is not going to be a closed circuit on both sides.
ME.17e.254.1	ME_17e	2.0	No Because she can turn one on at a time.
ME.17e.256.1	ME_17e	1.0	No because the D-cell in the middle.
ME.17e.291.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes.
ME.17e.313.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes she can. Because that is how you have to do it.
ME.17e.328.1	ME_17e	0.0	She can run both at the same time because, if it is going to the negative and to the positive and all the components are set up correctly in the right way it will work.
ME.17e.111.1	ME_17e	1.0	No because the switch is hooked in the middle.
ME.17e.147.1	ME_17e	0.0	Yes if it go in a circle.
ME.17e.195.1	ME_17e	0.0	She can too because it will be in a It will be a closed circuit.
ME.17e.212.1	ME_17e	1.0	No she cannot, because the battery D-cell cannot hold that much energy.
