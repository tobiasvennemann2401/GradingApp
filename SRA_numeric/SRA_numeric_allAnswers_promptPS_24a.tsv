PS.24a.104.1	PS_24a	0.0	Because cup is in the middle and it is the lowest.
PS.24a.105.1	PS_24a	2.0	The reason why is because when the string gets tighter The sound gets higher and when The string is loose it make a lower sound.
PS.24a.107.1	PS_24a	0.0	The cup is making the pitch higher.
PS.24a.110.1	PS_24a	1.0	By plucking the string and once you pluck the small string it will be high.
PS.24a.111.1	PS_24a	0.0	The pitch gets higher when the string is shorter and the pitch gets lower when the string is longer.
PS.24a.114.1	PS_24a	0.0	Because when you put the cup down it makes a high pitch.
PS.24a.118.1	PS_24a	0.0	When you pull the string down it makes a higher. And when you pull up it makes a lower pitch.
PS.24a.138.1	PS_24a	2.0	It is tighter and if it is tighter it produces a higher pitch. If he plucked it at the end of the string it would vibrate faster.
PS.24a.141.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because there is more tension.
PS.24a.142.1	PS_24a	2.0	Dear David the more tight it becomes the more higher the pitch. It is not about the length.
PS.24a.145.1	PS_24a	2.0	The tighter the string the higher the pitch. It is not about the length.
PS.24a.146.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because it is like a rubber band hard you pull it the higher pitch it gets.
PS.24a.152.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because the string is tighter.
PS.24a.154.1	PS_24a	2.0	By pulling the string.
PS.24a.157.1	PS_24a	2.0	The pitch has to be softer. When you tighten the string it gets higher and when you loosen it gets lower.
PS.24a.171.1	PS_24a	0.0	It vibrates longer.
PS.24a.172.1	PS_24a	0.0	It has more string to vibrate.
PS.24a.176.1	PS_24a	1.0	What is causing the pitch to be higher is the short string.
PS.24a.181.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because the string is tighter so it makes a higher sound David.
PS.24a.183.1	PS_24a	2.0	The pitch get higher when you put a lot of tension on the string.
PS.24a.184.1	PS_24a	0.0	A low one.
PS.24a.185.1	PS_24a	0.0	The string gets longer.
PS.24a.191.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because he tightened the string too hard.
PS.24a.192.1	PS_24a	0.0	Dear David, the longer string is the Lower pitch.
PS.24a.193.1	PS_24a	1.0	The short string is high and the long one is lower.
PS.24a.194.1	PS_24a	0.0	Well I think That because maybe He has a skinny string.
PS.24a.195.1	PS_24a	0.0	I think it is because David pulled the string to the edge so it makes a higher sound.
PS.24a.212.1	PS_24a	0.0	A long length is a high pitch because it has more room to vibrate.
PS.24a.217.1	PS_24a	2.0	You put too much tension on it.
PS.24a.221.1	PS_24a	2.0	When you tighten something it gets tighter so it makes a higher pitch and when something tighten the string the more it can vibrate the more it can vibrate the higher the pitch.
PS.24a.222.1	PS_24a	2.0	I think you are plucking the string tighter so it is a higher pitch.
PS.24a.223.1	PS_24a	2.0	The pitch is higher because there is more tension.
PS.24a.225.1	PS_24a	1.0	Dear David the pitch gets higher because the string is shorter.
PS.24a.228.1	PS_24a	2.0	David, the cup makes the string tight.
PS.24a.230.1	PS_24a	2.0	When you pull it tighter the faster the string moves so it makes a higher pitch.
PS.24a.241.1	PS_24a	2.0	Pulling The string gives it a higher pitch if you pull it harder it makes a even higher pitch.
PS.24a.249.1	PS_24a	0.0	Because when it is tighter there is less tension. So it makes a higher pitch.
PS.24a.255.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because you are tightening the string and you get higher pitches.
PS.24a.261.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because if you pull down it makes the string tighter and when it is tight it make a higher pitch.
PS.24a.263.1	PS_24a	2.0	When you tighten the string and pluck it it is higher pitch but when you loosen it up it is low pitch.
PS.24a.314.1	PS_24a	0.0	Because it has less room to vibrate.
PS.24a.316.1	PS_24a	0.0	The cup is causing it to be a higher sound.
PS.24a.317.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because when you tighten it more it has less room to vibrate it gets higher.
PS.24a.319.1	PS_24a	0.0	A quarter past left of the cup.
PS.24a.320.1	PS_24a	0.0	Because he might pluck it when it is vibrating.
PS.24a.323.1	PS_24a	1.0	Because the string needs to be short.
PS.24a.328.1	PS_24a	2.0	The tighter it is the higher the pitch is.
PS.24a.329.1	PS_24a	0.0	Maybe the string is skinnier.
PS.24a.332.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because it is so tight.
PS.24a.334.1	PS_24a	0.0	When he pulls the string back farther back it will make a note.
PS.24a.384.1	PS_24a	0.0	By the volume.
PS.24a.391.1	PS_24a	2.0	The more tension the string has the higher the pitch gets.
PS.24a.401.1	PS_24a	1.0	You are not making the string longer.
PS.24a.452.1	PS_24a	0.0	Because it also got tighter which makes it higher.
PS.24a.454.1	PS_24a	2.0	When you tighten the string, it still stays the same. But the vibration can travel faster.
PS.24a.455.1	PS_24a	0.0	When you pulled the string lower, it is making where you pluck the FOSS-ukulele shorter. You are not plucking the string that you pull down.
PS.24a.457.1	PS_24a	2.0	The pitch gets higher because it is being tightened when the string is tightened it makes it also vibrate faster!
PS.24a.459.1	PS_24a	2.0	When you pull the string tighter it is shorter because if it was looser it would go down then up and the sound would get lost on the way.
PS.24a.461.1	PS_24a	2.0	It is, the pitch, is getting higher because you are adding more tension.
PS.24a.464.1	PS_24a	2.0	When you pull the string tighter it makes it louder because it has a shorter way to go so it is faster.
PS.24a.466.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because the tension is increasing when you pull the stick down. And the string has blocked the vibrations right here.
PS.24a.468.1	PS_24a	1.0	The pitch is high when the string is short because when you pluck the short string the sound travels through the string and make a high pitch.
PS.24a.469.1	PS_24a	2.0	David, when you pull down the string you are not making the string lower. When you tighten the string and pluck the string, like you did the vibrations are going to travel faster and as high frequency means high pitch then the sound you are going to hear is going to be high pitched.
PS.24a.486.1	PS_24a	0.0	The short string makes a high sound and the long string makes it a low sound.
PS.24a.488.1	PS_24a	1.0	Because the vibration is faster when it is small and when it is longer the vibration is slow to travel.
PS.24a.490.1	PS_24a	2.0	The pitch is higher because you tightened the string more.
PS.24a.491.1	PS_24a	0.0	David pitch is not happening tension is happening okay so calm down.
PS.24a.494.1	PS_24a	2.0	Tension. David this is why because when you tighten it and pluck it will get higher just the way it is.
PS.24a.495.1	PS_24a	0.0	David this is why because you do not listen to your teacher. If the string is long, the pitch will be high.
PS.24a.497.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because when you pull it tighter to the short side the pitch get higher.
PS.24a.499.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because the tension is tighter.
PS.24a.501.1	PS_24a	2.0	It because the tension.
PS.24a.502.1	PS_24a	0.0	This is why the pitch is getting louder because you made it tighter and longer.
PS.24a.504.1	PS_24a	0.0	Because it is a long string.
PS.24a.505.1	PS_24a	0.0	Because you are not pull the string.
PS.24a.508.1	PS_24a	2.0	The pitch is getting high because you pull the string harder.
PS.24a.509.1	PS_24a	0.0	The pitch gets higher when you pluck it hard.
PS.24a.524.1	PS_24a	2.0	Dear David the string length does not change it travels faster because it is to tight to stay in place.
PS.24a.526.1	PS_24a	0.0	Dear David the pitch gets higher because you have to pluck the sound source.
PS.24a.528.1	PS_24a	2.0	The pitch gets higher because of the tension. When you pull harder on the string, it gets higher. Tension is how tight something is.
PS.24a.531.1	PS_24a	1.0	Dear David the pitch is getting higher because you are making it shorter that is why.
PS.24a.532.1	PS_24a	2.0	Dear David, it sounds higher because you tighten it when you pull.
PS.24a.533.1	PS_24a	2.0	Dear David, The pitch gets higher because when the string is tight, it makes higher.
PS.24a.536.1	PS_24a	2.0	Dear David, the pitch gets higher because you pull it tighter so it makes a higher pitch.
PS.24a.539.1	PS_24a	2.0	Dear David The pitch gets higher because the tighter you pull tighter it get.
PS.24a.557.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because it is tighter so it does not have much room to vibrate.
PS.24a.561.1	PS_24a	0.0	The string cause the pitch to be higher.
PS.24a.562.1	PS_24a	0.0	The low string would make a higher sound and the high string would make a low sound.
PS.24a.567.1	PS_24a	1.0	The small pitch is higher because the small one is causing the sound.
PS.24a.574.1	PS_24a	0.0	Because it cause vibration.
PS.24a.593.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because you pulled the string harder.
PS.24a.595.1	PS_24a	0.0	Because it probably not getting pulled high enough.
PS.24a.596.1	PS_24a	0.0	So David you can not figure out what if you tightening one string and then loose it and pluck.
PS.24a.599.1	PS_24a	2.0	The pitch is higher because you are pulling the string harder so it is higher but if you pull the string looser you will get a lower sound.
PS.24a.600.1	PS_24a	0.0	The string get lower because the string is tight.
PS.24a.602.1	PS_24a	0.0	It could be that he plucked harder than before.
PS.24a.603.1	PS_24a	0.0	Something small goes faster and lower but something big goes slower and higher.
PS.24a.605.1	PS_24a	0.0	Maybe when you pull it tighter and the string gets a little bit loose so it made a higher sound.
PS.24a.607.1	PS_24a	2.0	It gets higher because when you tighten it up, the tension gets high up.
PS.24a.610.1	PS_24a	1.0	Well you are actually making the string shorter because see the vibration is stopping at the table side. Look. But you were right on the pitch.
PS.24a.626.1	PS_24a	0.0	Dear David, it has a higher pitch because the vibrations.
PS.24a.629.1	PS_24a	2.0	It makes a high pitch because the string is tight so it makes a higher pitch if the long string was loose it would make a low pitch.
PS.24a.633.1	PS_24a	2.0	Because it is more tight and short and then it is high.
PS.24a.641.1	PS_24a	0.0	It make a high pitch.
PS.24a.644.1	PS_24a	0.0	It matters where you pluck it not how long the string is.
