SE.22c.103.1	SE_22c	2.0	More than one manipulated variable.
SE.22c.108.1	SE_22c	2.0	It has too many manipulated variables it could not give the same information.
SE.22c.133.1	SE_22c	0.0	I think red reflected the heat away.
SE.22c.137.1	SE_22c	0.0	Maybe because they are each different types.
SE.22c.141.1	SE_22c	1.0	Because one is covered and the other is not covered.
SE.22c.148.1	SE_22c	0.0	Because they are different colors.
SE.22c.154.1	SE_22c	1.0	I think it is covered more than the red one. And put does too color because is almost the same.
SE.22c.156.1	SE_22c	0.0	Because the red uncovered get colder and the blue get hotter.
SE.22c.182.1	SE_22c	2.0	It would not be useful because red is uncovered and blue is covered and it is not fair.
SE.22c.184.1	SE_22c	0.0	I think that the red covered was not in the sun.
SE.22c.189.1	SE_22c	2.0	It will not be useful, because blue is covered and the heat will be trap and red is not. So all the heat will escape from the red uncover. The red uncover will heat up slow. But blue will heat up fast.
SE.22c.247.1	SE_22c	2.0	Maybe the blue uncovered would be the same as the red or not, just to make sure.
SE.22c.313.1	SE_22c	2.0	Because you would not know the readings of blue uncovered and red covered.
SE.22c.317.1	SE_22c	1.0	Because both of them are different one is uncovered and another is covered.
SE.22c.327.1	SE_22c	0.0	Because it will just be in the middle of hot and cold.
SE.22c.336.1	SE_22c	0.0	Because.
SE.22c.383.1	SE_22c	0.0	Because you do not have enough information to compare the data.
SE.22c.392.1	SE_22c	0.0	Because it is only 2 colors.
SE.22c.394.1	SE_22c	1.0	Because the red uncovered has a low temperature and blue covered has a high temperature.
SE.22c.396.1	SE_22c	2.0	Because if they are different color and covered and uncovered you would get way different data.
SE.22c.397.1	SE_22c	0.0	The red does not heat up fast as the blue covered.
SE.22c.436.1	SE_22c	2.0	It would not provide useful information because you would not know if either red covered or blue covered absorbed most heat or if red uncovered or blue uncovered absorbed most heat.
SE.22c.440.1	SE_22c	2.0	It will not be only little information and also there is not test of red covered and blue uncovered.
SE.22c.494.1	SE_22c	1.0	It would not provide useful information because you would also need to know how much the blue heated up covered to.
SE.22c.501.1	SE_22c	2.0	Because then you would not know if the red covered or the blue uncovered heated up as much as the others. Because even though they are the same color the water is in a different environment. So, it would not provide useful information.
SE.22c.503.1	SE_22c	2.0	Because then you would not be controlling the variables.
SE.22c.510.1	SE_22c	1.0	Because it did not use all the colors so they could not find out what one heated up more.
SE.22c.517.1	SE_22c	2.0	Because they have 2 variables changed lid or no lid and color are the 2 they changed.
SE.22c.530.1	SE_22c	2.0	It would not tell the difference if blue is warmer the red or uncover heat up slower than cover.
SE.22c.597.1	SE_22c	1.0	Because you are comparing 2 thing and it would not make any sense because you know black heats faster than white.
SE.22c.598.1	SE_22c	0.0	Because they are the same temperature.
SE.22c.599.1	SE_22c	0.0	I chose that because when the plastic is darker it will heat faster than a light color.
SE.22c.610.1	SE_22c	2.0	That will not not provide useful information because you would only know blue covered red uncovered.
SE.22c.611.1	SE_22c	0.0	Because red uncovered is smaller than the blue covered heater.
SE.22c.615.1	SE_22c	0.0	Uncovered versus covered would not help but both of each would.
SE.22c.621.1	SE_22c	0.0	Because they are both covered.
SE.22c.166.1	SE_22c	2.0	Because the red is uncovered and blue is covered and you cannot compare them.
SE.22c.248.1	SE_22c	2.0	Red uncovered water is not really hot, and the blue covered is hot, so when you compare them you would not get that much of useful information.
SE.22c.401.1	SE_22c	0.0	Because one is uncovered and one is covered. Also I think because they are now the same color.
SE.22c.527.1	SE_22c	0.0	Because blue goes so high and red goes so low you cannot tell anything.
