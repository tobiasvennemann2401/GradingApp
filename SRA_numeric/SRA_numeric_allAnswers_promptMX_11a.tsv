MX.11a.119.1	MX_11a	0.0	Maybe it could change to him and have something die.
MX.11a.126.1	MX_11a	0.0	I think jam is mixture.
MX.11a.151.1	MX_11a	2.0	Because they dissolved.
MX.11a.176.1	MX_11a	2.0	When the mixture is clear and no material is on the bottom.
MX.11a.267.1	MX_11a	0.0	The evidence Jim has is the material on the bottom and the solid because a solution has 2 or more things combined.
MX.11a.282.1	MX_11a	2.0	That the water is clear.
MX.11a.304.1	MX_11a	2.0	My evidence is a solution can be clear or evaporated by heat and so all of them are clear.
MX.11a.356.1	MX_11a	2.0	The evidence he has is that it is clear and nothing on bottom to be a solution.
MX.11a.390.1	MX_11a	2.0	Because it was clear and nothing on the bottom.
MX.11a.391.1	MX_11a	2.0	He put the solid in the water and the solid dissolved into the water.
MX.11a.399.1	MX_11a	2.0	Mixtures one, 3, and possibly 2 are clear a sign that the material has dissolved and made a solution.
MX.11a.418.1	MX_11a	2.0	Mixtures one and 2 are solutions because they are clear.
MX.11a.424.1	MX_11a	2.0	It has to be clear with nothing on bottom.
MX.11a.426.1	MX_11a	2.0	When the solid material is disappeared.
MX.11a.431.1	MX_11a	0.0	I know it is a solid because it has stuff in the but mine.
MX.11a.432.1	MX_11a	0.0	That there is undissolved particle at the bottom.
MX.11a.434.1	MX_11a	0.0	Mixtures 4 and 5 are evidence.
MX.11a.438.1	MX_11a	2.0	Because a solution is clear.
MX.11a.463.1	MX_11a	2.0	He has that he put a solute in the solvent and it came out clear and nothing on bottom.
MX.11a.473.1	MX_11a	2.0	His evidence is the mixture turned clear.
MX.11a.487.1	MX_11a	2.0	If the material dissolved it is a solution.
MX.11a.492.1	MX_11a	2.0	Because the solid dissolve.
MX.11a.493.1	MX_11a	0.0	The evidence is the water cannot take any more ingredients.
MX.11a.496.1	MX_11a	2.0	Because there is nothing at the bottom.
MX.11a.498.1	MX_11a	2.0	That if it does have material at the bottom that it is not.
MX.11a.499.1	MX_11a	2.0	Because the solid dissolve.
MX.11a.501.1	MX_11a	2.0	There is material on the bottom and that means it is saturated solution.
MX.11a.503.1	MX_11a	2.0	Because some of them have a dissolved solid.
MX.11a.525.1	MX_11a	2.0	The mixtures are clear.
MX.11a.567.1	MX_11a	0.0	How much water is in it, and how much spoons of solid are in it.
MX.11a.569.1	MX_11a	2.0	When the solid disappears into the solvent.
MX.11a.595.1	MX_11a	2.0	His mixture is clear.
MX.11a.599.1	MX_11a	0.0	One spoon.
MX.11a.602.1	MX_11a	0.0	He does not have an idea that island make a salt outline.
MX.11a.392.1	MX_11a	2.0	That it is clear that is how he can know.
MX.11a.464.1	MX_11a	2.0	Mixture one and 3 are both clear and nothing on bottom.
MX.11a.500.1	MX_11a	2.0	Mixture one and 2 are clear.
MX.11a.641.1	MX_11a	0.0	The mixture 4 and 5 are saturated and a mixture is not a solution until it is saturated.
