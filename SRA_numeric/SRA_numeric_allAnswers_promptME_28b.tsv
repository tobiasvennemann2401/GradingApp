ME.28b.xx-1.1	ME_28b	1.0	Because they are repelling each other always.
ME.28b.xx-10.1	ME_28b	2.0	The magnets are not touching because they cannot attract to each other if they are north to north or south to south.
ME.28b.xx-11.1	ME_28b	0.0	The magnets will maybe not stick because the force of the magnets will maybe the pencil is long and the magnets cannot feel the other magnets.
ME.28b.xx-12.1	ME_28b	1.0	They are repelling.
ME.28b.xx-13.1	ME_28b	0.0	The magnets are on the side when they repel each other.
ME.28b.xx-14.1	ME_28b	1.0	They are on the same side.
ME.28b.xx-15.1	ME_28b	0.0	The rings do not touch each other because the magnets are facing positive to negative.
ME.28b.xx-16.1	ME_28b	1.0	They do not touch each other because one side of the magnet has a force and the other side stick to each other because they do not have a force.
ME.28b.xx-17.1	ME_28b	1.0	The magnets do not touch each other because either the north and north sides are facing each other or on the south and south sides are facing each other.
ME.28b.xx-18.1	ME_28b	2.0	The rings do not touch each other because the rings are magnets so they repel because 2 south and north facing each other.
ME.28b.xx-19.1	ME_28b	1.0	Because the rings are magnets and they are facing each other on the same side.
ME.28b.xx-2.1	ME_28b	2.0	The magnets do not touch because the same poles are together so they all repel.
ME.28b.xx-20.1	ME_28b	0.0	They do not touch each other because the force of magnetism is repelling them away from each other.
ME.28b.xx-21.1	ME_28b	1.0	The magnets do not touch because if you flip the magnet to the other side it will not stick because it makes them different.
ME.28b.xx-23.1	ME_28b	0.0	The rings are not touch each other because they are not facing the right way.
ME.28b.xx-24.1	ME_28b	0.0	The rings are made out of metal because they are repelling.
ME.28b.xx-28.1	ME_28b	0.0	The magnets are not touching because the magnetic force is making the magnets repel.
ME.28b.xx-29.1	ME_28b	1.0	They are not touching each other because they are repelling.
ME.28b.xx-3.1	ME_28b	1.0	Because they are not attracting.
ME.28b.xx-30.1	ME_28b	0.0	The magnets are not touching because they are flipped around a certain way that they do not stick instead they repel.
ME.28b.xx-31.1	ME_28b	0.0	They are not touching each other because either the North and North part of the magnets are touching or the south and south are touching.
ME.28b.xx-32.1	ME_28b	2.0	They are not touching because there are a north and south on a magnet and the north is facing the other north.
ME.28b.xx-33.1	ME_28b	0.0	The north pole and another north pole are touching on the magnet or the south pole and south pole which makes them repel.
ME.28b.xx-34.1	ME_28b	1.0	Because the magnets have a north and south pole and if the north touches the north or visa-versa north the will not touch.
ME.28b.xx-35.1	ME_28b	0.0	The rings do not touch each other because if the magnets are not the right way they will repel.
ME.28b.xx-36.1	ME_28b	0.0	The rings do not touch because the magnets were facing the same way which makes them float.
ME.28b.xx-37.1	ME_28b	2.0	They do not touch each other because if you put magnet the magnets like this will not attract North to North. If you put magnets like this it will attract North to South. If you put it like this it will not attract South to South.
ME.28b.xx-4.1	ME_28b	1.0	The rings do not attach each other because they are flipped upside down.
ME.28b.xx-5.1	ME_28b	2.0	The rings do not touch because the top is south pole is the one below it is the south pole. When the poles are north and south they attract.
ME.28b.xx-6.1	ME_28b	0.0	The rings do not touch because the rings are just magnets and the magnets are on the repel side.
ME.28b.xx-7.1	ME_28b	1.0	They are not touching each other because they repel.
ME.28b.xx-9.1	ME_28b	0.0	Each magnet is pushing away from the magnet so they are attracting.
ME.28b.xx-22.1	ME_28b	1.0	The reason why the rings do not touch is because the magnetic force of the magnet are the same.
ME.28b.xx-25.1	ME_28b	1.0	They are not touching each other because the same poles are facing towards each other making them repel.
ME.28b.xx-26.1	ME_28b	0.0	It is not touching because it is the other way around.
ME.28b.xx-27.1	ME_28b	0.0	The reason the magnets on the pencil are not touching because of magnetic force.
