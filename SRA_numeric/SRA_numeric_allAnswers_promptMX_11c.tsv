MX.11c.101.1	MX_11c	0.0	Greater than because mixture 5 has the same amount of water with more spoons of solid.
MX.11c.113.1	MX_11c	0.0	Greater than because it have 5 spoon of clear material.
MX.11c.151.1	MX_11c	0.0	Mixture 5 because they have the same amount of water but mixture 5 has more spoon.
MX.11c.243.1	MX_11c	0.0	Greater than mixture 4.
MX.11c.255.1	MX_11c	1.0	It is the same because it has the same stuff at the bottom.
MX.11c.347.1	MX_11c	2.0	The same because in the picture of mixture 4 and 5, they show the same salt on the bottom.
MX.11c.364.1	MX_11c	1.0	They are the same and equal concentrated.
MX.11c.381.1	MX_11c	2.0	Mixtures is the same concentration, because both of the mixtures are saturated.
MX.11c.384.1	MX_11c	0.0	It is greater than because mixture 4 has more room to dissolve than mixture 5.
MX.11c.386.1	MX_11c	2.0	The same, because both solutions have the same saturation point so they have the same concentration and amount of solid.
MX.11c.390.1	MX_11c	2.0	The same because they both reached the saturation point.
MX.11c.399.1	MX_11c	2.0	They are the same amount concentrated because they have the same amount of water and dissolved material.
MX.11c.416.1	MX_11c	0.0	It is greater than because they have the same amount of water but 5 has one more spoon than 4.
MX.11c.418.1	MX_11c	2.0	They are the same because once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.
MX.11c.423.1	MX_11c	2.0	The same because once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.
MX.11c.425.1	MX_11c	0.0	The concentration is more in 5 because it has more material in it.
MX.11c.432.1	MX_11c	0.0	Greater than.
MX.11c.433.1	MX_11c	2.0	They are the same because when a solution is saturated, it is at its highest point of concentration.
MX.11c.439.1	MX_11c	2.0	They are the same because when the solution is saturated it is at its highest point of concentration.
MX.11c.456.1	MX_11c	2.0	The same because both solutions are saturated.
MX.11c.460.1	MX_11c	0.0	No because 5 has more scoops than 4.
MX.11c.463.1	MX_11c	2.0	Same because if they all have the same water and 4 is concentrated with 4 scoops and 5 with 5 scoops then the solubility is the same because of the same amount of water become crystal.
MX.11c.465.1	MX_11c	1.0	Same as mixture 4 because you cannot see them.
MX.11c.469.1	MX_11c	0.0	Mixture 5 is greater than mixture 4 because it has the same amount of water and at the bottom it is both clear material but it does not have the same amount of solid.
MX.11c.502.1	MX_11c	0.0	No because there is one extra spoon in 5.
MX.11c.531.1	MX_11c	2.0	Same because they are both saturated and it can only hold an equal amount.
MX.11c.533.1	MX_11c	0.0	Greater than because it has more scoops.
MX.11c.557.1	MX_11c	1.0	The same because it has the same amount of water.
MX.11c.560.1	MX_11c	2.0	Same. Because they are both saturated.
MX.11c.572.1	MX_11c	1.0	The same because they both have the same amount of water.
MX.11c.575.1	MX_11c	1.0	The same because once a solution is saturated it is at its greatest concentration.
MX.11c.626.1	MX_11c	0.0	One, 2, 3 they all are clear with no material on the bottom.
MX.11c.633.1	MX_11c	2.0	They both have material on the bottom.
MX.11c.635.1	MX_11c	2.0	Same they both are clear and there is material on bottom.
MX.11c.636.1	MX_11c	0.0	It is greater than because it has one more spoon of the solid.
MX.11c.304.1	MX_11c	0.0	Mixture 5 is greater than mixture 4, it had more solid.
MX.11c.385.1	MX_11c	2.0	The same because they are saturation and it cannot go any more.
MX.11c.532.1	MX_11c	1.0	Same because they both got something.
MX.11c.592.1	MX_11c	0.0	More because there is more solid.
