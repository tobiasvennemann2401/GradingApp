SE.31b.105.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Because it is larger. B is very skinny.
SE.31b.118.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Box A got hotter because the temperature in the graph helped me decide.
SE.31b.126.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Her box got the hottest so it had to be A. It had to be A because it was laying down and the sun could get in it more faster than David's.
SE.31b.129.1	SE_31b	1.0	A. The results help me find this out.
SE.31b.139.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Julie's box had more black so the box was hotter because the more black the more the heat the black absorb. So that is why I chose Julie's because in my graph hers was the highest.
SE.31b.150.1	SE_31b	1.0	A. I looked at the chart.
SE.31b.160.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. It has higher results and her box is long and of course skinny.
SE.31b.191.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Solar water heater A was painted more black so that one got hotter.
SE.31b.250.1	SE_31b	0.0	Both. They are both have the same centimeters but A is down and B is up so A and B are the same but different.
SE.31b.257.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. The box had a bigger black spot to hold and attract more heat.
SE.31b.258.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Because more heat would go into the small box than the long big box.
SE.31b.265.1	SE_31b	1.0	A. I think Julie is A because when first temperature. I did her first so I think she is A.
SE.31b.314.1	SE_31b	0.0	B. Because Julie's has bigger numbers in the chart and letter B looks bigger but with the same amount of everything.
SE.31b.315.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. A because black is shown more on the bottom and so the black absorbed the heat.
SE.31b.320.1	SE_31b	0.0	B. Because his temperature is more taller than David because they are different by how they are.
SE.31b.331.1	SE_31b	0.0	B. Because B is more taller and it has a smaller top and it is not that extended like A. A is a transfer rate of heat. B preserves more solar energy.
SE.31b.393.1	SE_31b	1.0	A. Water can heat up faster in a wide tank because the water is not deep. Julie has the hottest degree Celsius.
SE.31b.405.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Box A is laid horizontally. The sun is hitting mostly the top. Box A has a bigger top than box B. Thus making box A hotter.
SE.31b.406.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. A is set flat down on the ground spreading the water around and it has a larger black space which will absorb more heat heating the water faster.
SE.31b.407.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. I choose A because it heated up faster and was spread out so it heated up faster.
SE.31b.430.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Since more of hers were on the ground on something dark it would absorb more heat because dark colors absorb more heat.
SE.31b.443.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. The evidence that supports my answer is A box because with a long section colored black, the solar heater would absorb more heat and the temperature under Julie's name because the temperature is hotter than David's.
SE.31b.492.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Because her box got the highest temperature. And it had more room to heat it up.
SE.31b.494.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. The evidence that supports my answer is that box A had more black in it and the sun would absorb box A more.
SE.31b.521.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. I picked A because the inside had more black space.
SE.31b.525.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Because there is more black tarp and under Julie it has higher temperatures. And more black heats up faster so Julie's is A.
SE.31b.529.1	SE_31b	0.0	A. Because the solar energy meets the collector sooner because it is shorter, so it heats up quicker.
SE.31b.531.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Julie's temperature went higher than David because she has more square units of solar collectors.
SE.31b.536.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Well the more area black covers the hotter it will get. Just like in the table. Since A covers more I thought that A would be a perfect match with the table.
SE.31b.548.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Because the more black tarp you have, the hotter it is going to get.
SE.31b.574.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Because the bigger box heats up fast and Julie's temperatures were high.
SE.31b.594.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Because she had higher temperatures than David.
SE.31b.597.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. The evidence that supports my answer is the chart or table. I looked at both the temperatures and solar water heaters and I decide, using the chart or table, that A is Julie's.
SE.31b.608.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Julie made box A because her temperatures were high. Box A has more black than box B. So box A will absorb more heat since it has more black.
SE.31b.610.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. It is box A because the box has more black than the other box and it absorbs the sun is heat.
SE.31b.611.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. A because it has more black painted than in box B so A absorbs more than B.
SE.31b.246.1	SE_31b	0.0	B. That they both painted black on the inside in the bottom and filled the top with liters of water. And the heaters will set the sun.
SE.31b.313.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. When a box has more black than the other it will heat up faster, and hotter.
SE.31b.507.1	SE_31b	2.0	A. Because Julie's had more black flooring. The more black flooring you get the hotter it gets. Julie's side of the chart had the highest temperature. So box A is hers.
SE.31b.530.1	SE_31b	0.0	B. Because in B, it is long and it hold more heat.
