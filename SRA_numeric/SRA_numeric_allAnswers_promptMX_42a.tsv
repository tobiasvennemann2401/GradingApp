MX.42a.101.1	MX_42a	2.0	The solid was too big to go through the filter paper.
MX.42a.106.1	MX_42a	2.0	Because the little piece of the liquid and the undissolved is bigger.
MX.42a.126.1	MX_42a	0.0	It is separate because the paper filter is liquid.
MX.42a.172.1	MX_42a	1.0	Because the solid is too heavy to go through the paper.
MX.42a.291.1	MX_42a	2.0	Solid is too big to go through the filter hole. Liquid is just water that can go through almost anything.
MX.42a.389.1	MX_42a	0.0	Because the filter cannot hold the water because the filter already has water in it.
MX.42a.394.1	MX_42a	2.0	The holes in the filter are smaller than the solid particles, and the water particles are smaller than the holes, so the water goes through the filter while the solid will not go through.
MX.42a.397.1	MX_42a	1.0	Because the particle size was too big and the filter could not hold any more water because it was wet.
MX.42a.423.1	MX_42a	0.0	Because when the solid touches the side, it sticks.
MX.42a.432.1	MX_42a	2.0	Because the solid was bigger than the liquid so it got stuck!
MX.42a.448.1	MX_42a	0.0	Because she did not wet the filter and when she put the water they got wet.
MX.42a.452.1	MX_42a	2.0	Because the materials are too big to go through the holes but the water is not too big to go through the holes in the filter.
MX.42a.453.1	MX_42a	1.0	It stays in the filter because the solid material does not count as the solution.
MX.42a.454.1	MX_42a	2.0	The solid does not go through the filter like the liquid because the liquid is small enough to go through the filter but the solid is too large.
MX.42a.458.1	MX_42a	1.0	Because it is a thick.
MX.42a.462.1	MX_42a	2.0	Because the holes in the filter are too small for the solid to go through them.
MX.42a.466.1	MX_42a	2.0	The solid stayed in because it was too big to go through the microscopic holes in the filter paper.
MX.42a.470.1	MX_42a	2.0	The solid stays in the filter because the particles are too big to go through but dissolved can go through because the particles are small enough.
MX.42a.472.1	MX_42a	2.0	It stays at the top because it is too big to go through the filter and the water is just a liquid.
MX.42a.473.1	MX_42a	1.0	The solid is hard. It cannot go through because it is not a liquid.
MX.42a.490.1	MX_42a	2.0	Because the solute in the saturated solution dissolved and were dispersed equally. The material that did not go through was too big to go through.
MX.42a.497.1	MX_42a	1.0	Because the materials are stuck together with water and cannot go through the tiny holes in the filter.
MX.42a.502.1	MX_42a	0.0	Because when the water goes through the filter some water stays which helps the filter catch the sugar.
MX.42a.524.1	MX_42a	2.0	Because it is too thick to slide down the filter.
MX.42a.532.1	MX_42a	2.0	Because the solid stay because it is too big and water it can just go through things like that.
MX.42a.540.1	MX_42a	1.0	Because they are big.
MX.42a.543.1	MX_42a	1.0	The solid stayed in because it was not as watery and it was bigger chucks. The liquid is watery and so it went through.
MX.42a.559.1	MX_42a	1.0	The solid stays in the filter because the filter's holes are too small for the liquid to go through.
MX.42a.562.1	MX_42a	1.0	Because paper absorbent and solids cannot go through solids.
MX.42a.563.1	MX_42a	1.0	The liquid was too big to go through the holes.
MX.42a.567.1	MX_42a	2.0	Because in the filter paper there are little holes!
MX.42a.568.1	MX_42a	2.0	The solid would be too big to pass through the small holes in the filter paper.
MX.42a.575.1	MX_42a	2.0	The solid stays because its particle size was too large to go through the filter.
MX.42a.596.1	MX_42a	0.0	Because water goes through the paper and the salt is not water.
MX.42a.604.1	MX_42a	1.0	Because the liquid is a substance that can go through most objects with small or tiny holes and solid cannot.
MX.42a.607.1	MX_42a	0.0	Because the solid did not dissolve.
MX.42a.416.1	MX_42a	2.0	Because the solid is big and it cannot go through the filter paper.
MX.42a.460.1	MX_42a	2.0	The solid stays because it is bigger than the holes in filter and stay in the filter.
MX.42a.500.1	MX_42a	2.0	The solid is bigger than the holes in the filter.
MX.42a.601.1	MX_42a	0.0	Because you cannot handle the water. For example we cannot handle water on our hands but we can handle solid things.
