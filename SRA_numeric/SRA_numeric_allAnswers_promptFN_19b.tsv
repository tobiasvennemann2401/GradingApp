FN.19b.103.1	FN_19b	0.0	Putting the bag of yeast, warm whatever the food sample you are tasting.
FN.19b.106.1	FN_19b	1.0	Whichever food has the most carbohydrates has more sugar. And that is how she will know her results.
FN.19b.139.1	FN_19b	1.0	Finally Susan will have to get a volume tube put the bag in it and press down. Then you are done.
FN.19b.145.1	FN_19b	2.0	Susan will know which food contains the most sugar by how high the volume tube goes. Look at the one with the highest number or highest volume tube.
FN.19b.152.1	FN_19b	2.0	If one puff up more that means that it has sugar in it.
FN.19b.176.1	FN_19b	2.0	She will know because the bag that was highest in the volume tube when pressing down has the most sugar.
FN.19b.181.1	FN_19b	2.0	The number that is higher when you put the bags in them push until pressure has more sugar.
FN.19b.188.1	FN_19b	1.0	By how much carbon dioxide. The fattest bag.
FN.19b.219.1	FN_19b	2.0	When the volume tube shows that the food has more carbon dioxide in it, that means that food has the most sugar.
FN.19b.247.1	FN_19b	2.0	By the volume tube how much carbon dioxide. The more carbon dioxide the more sugar.
FN.19b.250.1	FN_19b	2.0	Susan will know how much sugar is in the foods by putting each bag in a volume tube one at a time. When her finder stops after pushing the top, the bottom of the part she pushes down will be on a number. That number is the milliliters of sugar in the food. Whichever number is the highest, that means that food has the most sugar.
FN.19b.253.1	FN_19b	1.0	Whichever bag has the highest recording has the most sugar.
FN.19b.292.1	FN_19b	1.0	She will know because one bag will be different.
FN.19b.293.1	FN_19b	1.0	If how much carbon dioxide there is in the volume tube.
FN.19b.294.1	FN_19b	2.0	The food with most carbon dioxide has the most sugar.
FN.19b.299.1	FN_19b	2.0	Susan will know which food contains the most sugar seeing which one has the most carbon dioxide.
FN.19b.326.1	FN_19b	2.0	The bag with the most carbon dioxide has the most sugar in it.
FN.19b.330.1	FN_19b	2.0	The food that has the most, carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide has the most sugar.
FN.19b.408.1	FN_19b	2.0	When the timer stop for 10 minutes put the baggie into the volume tube to see which food had the most sugar.
FN.19b.421.1	FN_19b	2.0	She will know which one has the most sugar by measuring the volume and if the food has a lot of sugar. You will see it because it will have a lot of carbon dioxide in the bag.
FN.19b.426.1	FN_19b	2.0	She will know how much sugar does one have by looking at the bags. If one has a lot of air then that one produces more sugar.
FN.19b.427.1	FN_19b	1.0	The yeast will react and the bag is going to fill up with and measure it with air and measure it with a volume measure.
FN.19b.430.1	FN_19b	2.0	The one that has the most sugar is inflated and fat.
FN.19b.438.1	FN_19b	0.0	I will have big grease stain.
FN.19b.439.1	FN_19b	2.0	The more sugar the more carbon dioxide and the more carbon dioxide the bigger the volume.
FN.19b.448.1	FN_19b	1.0	Maybe by using the value shared.
FN.19b.468.1	FN_19b	2.0	Compare the bags and see which one has the most gas in the bag. The one that has the most has the most carbohydrates or sugar.
FN.19b.481.1	FN_19b	2.0	The more air in the bag, the more sugar.
FN.19b.486.1	FN_19b	2.0	Compare the bags to see which bag has more carbon dioxide in it 50, the more carbon dioxide in the bag the more sugar the food has.
FN.19b.495.1	FN_19b	2.0	She would know by the volume tube.
FN.19b.498.1	FN_19b	2.0	The more carbon dioxide the more sugar.
FN.19b.545.1	FN_19b	2.0	Whichever one has the most carbon dioxide in the baggy has the most carbohydrates.
FN.19b.572.1	FN_19b	1.0	Whatever has the most milliliters of poop will have the most sugar.
FN.19b.575.1	FN_19b	0.0	The one without the fat spot.
FN.19b.612.1	FN_19b	1.0	Whichever food item has the highest number. The highest one is the one with more sugar in it.
FN.19b.613.1	FN_19b	2.0	There will be more, bubbles, gas than the other.
FN.19b.216.1	FN_19b	1.0	Susan will know which food contains the most sugar by comparing the amount of carbon dioxide each food sample has.
FN.19b.424.1	FN_19b	1.0	The bag will be full of carbohydrate and it will be fat.
FN.19b.514.1	FN_19b	2.0	She will know by measuring it also whichever has more bubbles.
FN.19b.532.1	FN_19b	1.0	Whichever one has the highest volume.
