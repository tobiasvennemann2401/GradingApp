ME.73.101.1	ME_73	2.0	She would put and back it to a D-cell.
ME.73.102.1	ME_73	0.0	Stick it into the clips and close the switch.
ME.73.105.1	ME_73	1.0	She should hook the extra wire from the wrapping part and connect the wires to the switch and D-cell battery. Then stick a short wire to connect the D-cell and switch.
ME.73.107.1	ME_73	2.0	Wendy will connect the wire to a D-cell battery and switch, switch optional.
ME.73.111.1	ME_73	2.0	She should hook it to a D-cell.
ME.73.118.1	ME_73	2.0	Hook the wires to the power source.
ME.73.119.1	ME_73	2.0	Connect it to a battery and a switch.
ME.73.120.1	ME_73	2.0	Connect one of the tips of the long wire to the switch. Connect the other long end of the wire to the D-cell and connect the short wire to the D-cell and the switch.
ME.73.123.1	ME_73	1.0	Hook the wire to a D-cell. Get a switch and another wire hook that wire to the switch. Get something made of metal. Press the top of the nail to the metal thing, they should stick.
ME.73.140.1	ME_73	2.0	Get another wire hook it with the D-cell and the switch get the insulated wire and hook it to the switch and D-cell then turn it on with the switch and there a electromagnet.
ME.73.141.1	ME_73	2.0	Get a D-cell and a switch, connect the insulated wire to the switch and battery and you have an electromagnet.
ME.73.142.1	ME_73	0.0	She should see if the magnet works as a electromagnet.
ME.73.146.1	ME_73	0.0	She should get a D-cell to make it work.
ME.73.147.1	ME_73	2.0	Put the wires to the D-cell.
ME.73.152.1	ME_73	1.0	Attach the wire to each end of the nail.
ME.73.154.1	ME_73	2.0	She should hook the wire to the D-cell and switch and see if it will pick up iron or steel.
ME.73.155.1	ME_73	0.0	Wendy, you should have a D-cell or a D-cell it does not matter. And a switch if you want it to work.
ME.73.159.1	ME_73	0.0	Get a D-cell and a switch.
ME.73.174.1	ME_73	2.0	Wendy can hook one side of the wire to a switch, and the other side of the wire to the negative side of the D-cell after that get another small wire and hook that to the positive side of the D-cell and to the top of the switch.
ME.73.176.1	ME_73	2.0	She should attach one wire to a D-cell and the other to a switch. Then, she connects the D-cell and switch with a wire.
ME.73.180.1	ME_73	2.0	Wendy should get a D-cell and hook it up to the insulated wire and get a switch and hook some wires up to that, then she should get little washers and put them somewhere. Then you have an electromagnet.
ME.73.181.1	ME_73	1.0	Wendy should connect all the wires then to see if it works Wendy can try to pick up some washers.
ME.73.185.1	ME_73	2.0	Wendy should connect the insulated wire to a D-cell and a switch and that will be a complete circuit and it will attract iron or steel.
ME.73.189.1	ME_73	2.0	She should attach a switch to one side of the wire and attach the other to the D-cell. Attach another wire to the D-cell and switch.
ME.73.190.1	ME_73	2.0	Connect the wire to a D-cell and connect the wire to a switch and turn it on.
ME.73.195.1	ME_73	0.0	Wendy should plug in the electromagnet.
ME.73.207.1	ME_73	2.0	Wendy will get a battery and connect the wires to the battery, get a battery holder.
ME.73.208.1	ME_73	2.0	Connect it to a battery.
ME.73.214.1	ME_73	2.0	Then Wendy should get another piece of wire and wrap it around the nail also then connect the other end of the wire to a negative and a positive.
ME.73.215.1	ME_73	2.0	Hook the wires to both sides of a battery.
ME.73.217.1	ME_73	0.0	She needs a D-cell and washers.
ME.73.225.1	ME_73	1.0	Wendy should connect the long wire to the battery next.
ME.73.227.1	ME_73	0.0	Wendy needs to get little washers and stick the iron to the washer.
ME.73.250.1	ME_73	0.0	She would need a switch then she would turn on the switch she would also need a D-cell.
ME.73.252.1	ME_73	2.0	Connect the wire to the D-cell and turn it on.
ME.73.256.1	ME_73	0.0	She needs a D-cell to make it run.
ME.73.277.1	ME_73	2.0	Connect the wires to a battery or power source.
ME.73.283.1	ME_73	2.0	Hook it up to the D-cell then to the stick.
ME.73.328.1	ME_73	2.0	To complete the circuit she needs to connect both ends of the wire to both end of a D-cell. You can use a switch.
ME.73.113.1	ME_73	2.0	She would hook the wires up to the D-cell.
ME.73.144.1	ME_73	2.0	Connect the 2 end of the wires to the D-cell.
ME.73.206.1	ME_73	2.0	She needs a battery onto then, attach the wire to the battery.
ME.73.212.1	ME_73	2.0	Connect the wire tips to a D-cell.
