SE.22b.112.1	SE_22b	2.0	Blue is very attracted to the heat whether it is covered or not. Red is not attracted.
SE.22b.124.1	SE_22b	2.0	Blue will get hotter because it is a dark color and red is not.
SE.22b.127.1	SE_22b	2.0	The blue absorbs most of the sun and red did not absorb most of the sun.
SE.22b.128.1	SE_22b	0.0	That blue it is more dark than red.
SE.22b.129.1	SE_22b	2.0	The blue covered got hotter and in the same amount of time than the red.
SE.22b.139.1	SE_22b	2.0	Blue versus are warmer than red versus.
SE.22b.141.1	SE_22b	2.0	Blue is more darker so it absorbs more heat and that is why it is bigger.
SE.22b.148.1	SE_22b	2.0	It warms better.
SE.22b.149.1	SE_22b	2.0	That the blue will heat up faster than the red because the blue is darker.
SE.22b.151.1	SE_22b	0.0	Because the blue uncovered and the red covered is like the same like the blue uncovered.
SE.22b.155.1	SE_22b	0.0	That the blue might be darker than the red.
SE.22b.164.1	SE_22b	0.0	Because blue uncovered does not attract that much heat like the red one does.
SE.22b.175.1	SE_22b	2.0	The blue collects more heat, because it is more darker than red.
SE.22b.177.1	SE_22b	2.0	The blue color is kind of a color black and darker than red so that why the blue heat more than the red one.
SE.22b.179.1	SE_22b	2.0	The blue gets hotter than the red maybe because the blue is darker than the red.
SE.22b.242.1	SE_22b	2.0	The blue gathers more heat than the red.
SE.22b.254.1	SE_22b	2.0	Blue heats water better.
SE.22b.311.1	SE_22b	0.0	It is more better than using other colors.
SE.22b.313.1	SE_22b	2.0	If a color is dark it will heat up more than a light one so blue was dark red was light.
SE.22b.319.1	SE_22b	2.0	That heat up more fast than other.
SE.22b.325.1	SE_22b	2.0	It tells me that the blue is winning and not the red.
SE.22b.331.1	SE_22b	2.0	The blue heats up more than the red by just a little bit, so that tells the blue collects more solar energy.
SE.22b.341.1	SE_22b	0.0	That blue is really high and that the red does not cover nothing so that means he is last.
SE.22b.393.1	SE_22b	2.0	Blue absorb more heat than the red.
SE.22b.396.1	SE_22b	2.0	That blue must be darker soil will absorb more than the red.
SE.22b.398.1	SE_22b	2.0	The blue collectors had the highest effect it heated the most and the fastest.
SE.22b.402.1	SE_22b	2.0	The graph tells me that blue will heat up faster than red, probably because blue is darker, which attracts heat faster.
SE.22b.419.1	SE_22b	2.0	It tells me that blue heats the water more.
SE.22b.434.1	SE_22b	2.0	It tells me that the blue collectors heat up faster than the blue collectors.
SE.22b.439.1	SE_22b	2.0	The effect of using a blue cover can heat it up faster than red. Blue is also darker than red.
SE.22b.440.1	SE_22b	2.0	Since red is lighter color it does not absorb much like white, but blue is darker so it is a little like black.
SE.22b.441.1	SE_22b	2.0	The graph tells that the blue covered collected more heat than the red covered.
SE.22b.531.1	SE_22b	2.0	Using blue collectors heat up quicker than red collectors.
SE.22b.570.1	SE_22b	2.0	Tells me that blue covered and uncovered is hotter than red cover and uncovered.
SE.22b.594.1	SE_22b	2.0	That the blue heats more than the red.
SE.22b.244.1	SE_22b	2.0	Blue is a dark color so blue covered and uncovered are the warmest temperatures then red is a kind of lighter color so they go under the blue on the chart.
SE.22b.429.1	SE_22b	2.0	It tells you the blue covered and uncovered are hotter than the reds.
SE.22b.494.1	SE_22b	2.0	It tells you that blue heats up faster because it is a darker color than red.
SE.22b.565.1	SE_22b	2.0	That blue absorbs heat faster than the red.
