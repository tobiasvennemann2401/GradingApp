LF.13a.394.1	LF_13a	2.0	It goes to a different place.
LF.13a.404.1	LF_13a	2.0	Earth material gets deposited to another place.
LF.13a.418.1	LF_13a	0.0	They go to a different place.
LF.13a.419.1	LF_13a	0.0	The materials like burst away.
LF.13a.435.1	LF_13a	0.0	The earth materials that were weathered away by the erosion flow farther in water or just move away from where they were.
LF.13a.441.1	LF_13a	1.0	During deposition earth materials are moved to different places.
LF.13a.444.1	LF_13a	2.0	The eroded earth materials during deposition get deposited to a different area.
LF.13a.452.1	LF_13a	0.0	The earth material gets worn away.
LF.13a.469.1	LF_13a	0.0	The earth explains the and it will but it will explode.
LF.13a.477.1	LF_13a	0.0	What happens to it is that the deposition goes more far away from the stream table.
LF.13a.478.1	LF_13a	0.0	The earth material will break into little pieces.
LF.13a.504.1	LF_13a	0.0	First, erosion wears all the materials away. Then, deposition makes a v shaped valley.
LF.13a.515.1	LF_13a	2.0	They go to the mouth of river and deposits there.
LF.13a.516.1	LF_13a	0.0	The socks, sand, and clay start to make a bigger canyon.
LF.13a.661.1	LF_13a	1.0	The earth materials are carried away and dropped off at the end.
LF.13a.672.1	LF_13a	0.0	The earth materials get carried away during deposition.
LF.13a.678.1	LF_13a	0.0	Earth materials get carried away.
LF.13a.681.1	LF_13a	2.0	During deposition earth materials would get carried away to a new location.
LF.13a.682.1	LF_13a	2.0	Earth materials are washed away and settled to the bottom.
LF.13a.688.1	LF_13a	2.0	Earth materials are washed downstream and then start to build up land.

LF.13a.717.1	LF_13a	0.0	They are dark in new places.
LF.13a.732.1	LF_13a	1.0	The earth materials that have been eroded is deposited at the mouth of a river or stream forming a delta.
LF.13a.744.1	LF_13a	1.0	It is placed and left in deltas and riverbanks.
LF.13a.754.1	LF_13a	2.0	After deposition earth material is carried out to river banks. Deltas form and into the ocean.
LF.13a.770.1	LF_13a	0.0	The earth materials were broken down and separated.
