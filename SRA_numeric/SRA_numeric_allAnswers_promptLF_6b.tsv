LF.6b.391.1	LF_6b	0.0	Because if you make them flatter it might take a while but if you make it steeper it might be easier.
LF.6b.393.1	LF_6b	1.0	If you use a bigger hole more water come out at once like a raging river, if the slope is steeper the water will push through the earth material faster.
LF.6b.397.1	LF_6b	1.0	Because they both are stronger, flows harder and flows faster than the rest.
LF.6b.399.1	LF_6b	0.0	The happen when you do the experiment.
LF.6b.422.1	LF_6b	0.0	I chose these choices because the bigger hole would work because more water would make earth material wear away faster. I think the slope flatter the water would come down really fast.
LF.6b.427.1	LF_6b	0.0	Because there all can go steeper.
LF.6b.452.1	LF_6b	1.0	I think these will cause more erosion because with a bigger hole more water and with the slope steeper more faster.
LF.6b.456.1	LF_6b	0.0	Because I saw it.
LF.6b.462.1	LF_6b	0.0	Because too much water comes and because it needs to be steeper so not much water comes.
LF.6b.477.1	LF_6b	1.0	Because if we use a source with a bigger hole it will drop faster and makes it slope steeper.
LF.6b.481.1	LF_6b	0.0	Because slope because make thing steeper and.
LF.6b.493.1	LF_6b	1.0	The water pressure will be harder, so if that happens it will create a bigger canyon and delta. Erosion.
LF.6b.494.1	LF_6b	2.0	I chose source with a bigger hole and make the slope steeper because the hole would make the water come out more with water to make slope steeper because so the water will get more speed and to make more erosion.
LF.6b.497.1	LF_6b	0.0	Because when you use a bigger whole the canyon is deeper and when you have a slope all the water forms a canyon.
LF.6b.507.1	LF_6b	1.0	If you make a bigger hole then the water will be faster and erosion will too. And if you make the slope steeper then the erosion will become bigger and wider.
LF.6b.509.1	LF_6b	0.0	Because we did not experiment like that and it worked it did the same thing we marked.
LF.6b.510.1	LF_6b	1.0	I chose the ones I did because you the water to flow not slower.
LF.6b.511.1	LF_6b	1.0	Why a bigger hole makes more erosion is because there is more water coming at once. The reason to make the slop steeper is so the water will go much faster.
LF.6b.662.1	LF_6b	2.0	More water can cause more erosion because so much water is flowing through at a time. Also a steeper slope because the water will flow a lot faster.
LF.6b.664.1	LF_6b	1.0	Steep slopes can have landslides, faster water can gush. To be a flood plus massively erode.
LF.6b.665.1	LF_6b	1.0	If you use a water source with a bigger hole, more water will come out which will cause erosion. If you make the slope steeper, the water will run down faster.
LF.6b.667.1	LF_6b	1.0	The erosion will happen faster because the flow of the water is stronger and faster so the material will be worn down more.
LF.6b.673.1	LF_6b	2.0	I choose water source with a bigger hole because the more water the more momentum to destroy. I chose a slope because the water will travel fast.
LF.6b.688.1	LF_6b	1.0	A bigger water hole would allow more water to come through faster. Making the slope steeper and water would run through faster.
LF.6b.735.1	LF_6b	1.0	More water will make it faster to erode, a steeper hill will make it go faster down hill.
LF.6b.738.1	LF_6b	0.0	Well, they change the way erosion goes faster or lower and if it slides or not.
LF.6b.752.1	LF_6b	0.0	My house because more erosion because it is a greater mass.
LF.6b.768.1	LF_6b	0.0	So everything would happen quicker and better.
LF.6b.776.1	LF_6b	1.0	My choices cause more erosion because with a bigger hole more water comes out faster and when the slope is steeper the water goes down faster and very powerfully.
LF.6b.779.1	LF_6b	1.0	My choice increases water speed and the faster something is going the more it can hold.
LF.6b.814.1	LF_6b	1.0	Because the more water going at a faster pace because of the slopes will cause more erosion because gravity will help slope.
LF.6b.826.1	LF_6b	2.0	If the hole is bigger that will cause a flood. More water the more velocity causing more erosion. Also if make the slope steeper that will cause the velocity to be greater causing more erosion.
LF.6b.844.1	LF_6b	1.0	My choices cause more erosion because if you have a bigger hole more water can pour through and if the slope is steeper water will come down harder.
LF.6b.853.1	LF_6b	2.0	They cause more erosion because there is more water flowing out the hole making a flood and when it is elevated it makes the water move faster moving more sediment.
LF.6b.855.1	LF_6b	2.0	Making a bigger hole causes more water which makes it flow faster causing more erosion. Also having a steep slope makes water flow faster causing more erosion.
LF.6b.856.1	LF_6b	1.0	A bigger for the water's source and cause erosion because there is more water than usual. Then if you have a steeper slope it will cause the water to flow faster than usual.
LF.6b.467.1	LF_6b	0.0	Because if you used a slope steeper it will destroy the earth material.
LF.6b.680.1	LF_6b	2.0	I chose these choices because if there is a bigger hole then more water will flow through causing greater erosion. If the slope is steeper then the water will flow faster causing greater erosion..
LF.6b.689.1	LF_6b	2.0	If the water source has a bigger hole it would let out more water at one time, more water more erosion. If we make a steeper slope the water will have more momentum making it stronger to carry more earth materials.
LF.6b.743.1	LF_6b	1.0	Because more water would come out at once.
