ST.52a.474.1	ST_52a	0.0	When a seed germinates the root grows first to hold the plant up right.
ST.52a.486.1	ST_52a	0.0	It comes out before the other.
ST.52a.487.1	ST_52a	2.0	So it can gather water to grow.
ST.52a.502.1	ST_52a	0.0	Because that is a part of the plant.
ST.52a.504.1	ST_52a	0.0	The root grows fruit because root always grows first.
ST.52a.526.1	ST_52a	1.0	Because the root searches for the nutrients so the embryo germinates into a stem and leaves.
ST.52a.528.1	ST_52a	0.0	Root hair.
ST.52a.531.1	ST_52a	2.0	To get water for the seed.
