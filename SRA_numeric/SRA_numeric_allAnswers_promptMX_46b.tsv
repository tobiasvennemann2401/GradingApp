MX.46b.386.1	MX_46b	0.0	B has more solute than A does therefore B will weigh more since the solute is equally spread.
MX.46b.391.1	MX_46b	0.0	They are the same amount of water different in spoons. That is why B weighs more because of spoons.
MX.46b.425.1	MX_46b	0.0	Because you would have to take 50 milliliters of water out of cup B or else cup B would be heavier. So it would more fair.
MX.46b.429.1	MX_46b	0.0	I chose cup A because it seems more concentrated.
MX.46b.437.1	MX_46b	0.0	Because he pour only 50 milliliters of solution in each cup.
MX.46b.439.1	MX_46b	0.0	Because B is the double of A.
MX.46b.457.1	MX_46b	0.0	Because cup B has more spoons of the solute and has more water.
MX.46b.464.1	MX_46b	1.0	Because if you just took 50 milliliters of water out of each, they would be equal. I got this one wrong.
MX.46b.466.1	MX_46b	0.0	I think the second one because B has more scoops of solute.
MX.46b.467.1	MX_46b	0.0	Because now there is now only some of water in each and 4 is more than 2 and cup B more concentration.
MX.46b.471.1	MX_46b	0.0	I picked cup B because I thought it would have more spoons of solute than cup A.
MX.46b.472.1	MX_46b	2.0	I pick this one because if you split solution B into 2 water levels it will be 50 so if A is 50 and 2 spoons the other one is going to have to have 2 spoons too because the other one is double.
MX.46b.488.1	MX_46b	2.0	Because 2 is half of 4 spoons and 50 milliliters is half of 100.
MX.46b.493.1	MX_46b	2.0	Because Nigel took out the same amount of solutions. There is 2 spoons for 50 milliliters of water. The concentration are the same.
MX.46b.495.1	MX_46b	2.0	They both have 2 spoonfuls per 50 milliliters so when you compare 50 milliliters from each they both have 2 spoonfuls in the 50 milliliters.
MX.46b.499.1	MX_46b	0.0	Because they both have the same amount of water but have different amount of salt.
MX.46b.502.1	MX_46b	0.0	I think cup B would be more heavy because cup B is more concentrated.
MX.46b.524.1	MX_46b	1.0	They are going to be even.
MX.46b.528.1	MX_46b	0.0	Cup B is more concentrated than cup A.
MX.46b.540.1	MX_46b	0.0	Because solution B has more water in the top.
MX.46b.542.1	MX_46b	2.0	Because if he takes 50 milliliters out of A and puts it back in A it is still the same and if he takes 50 milliliters out of B and puts it back in then they are still both the same.
MX.46b.559.1	MX_46b	2.0	They are the same, because there is a pattern, for every 2 spoons of solute add 50 milliliters of water.
MX.46b.561.1	MX_46b	0.0	B because it gave 100 milliliters water and 4 spoons of solute. And A gave 5 milliliters water 2 spoon of salt so I stay with B.
MX.46b.563.1	MX_46b	2.0	I chose the same because he took bottle A and half of bottle B and half of bottle B equals A.
MX.46b.570.1	MX_46b	1.0	It is like x like 50 times 2 equals 100 so then 2 spoons of solute equals 50.
MX.46b.575.1	MX_46b	0.0	All solutions are mixtures, and a solution is when something disappears into the other.
MX.46b.595.1	MX_46b	0.0	Solution would need to be doubled.
MX.46b.597.1	MX_46b	0.0	Because he took the same amount from each bottle.
MX.46b.598.1	MX_46b	1.0	Because they both have the same amount of solution in each cup. So both cups weigh the same.
MX.46b.605.1	MX_46b	2.0	Because there is 2 spoons and 50 milliliters and then there is 4 spoons and 100 milliliters so they are going to weigh the same.
MX.46b.608.1	MX_46b	0.0	Because there is more water and solute.
MX.46b.612.1	MX_46b	0.0	I chose that one because in bottle B they took 50 milliliters but in it they put 4 spoons.
MX.46b.630.1	MX_46b	0.0	I chose this one because in the picture above there is more water in cup B.
MX.46b.640.1	MX_46b	0.0	Solution B has more water so it weighs more than solution A.
MX.46b.643.1	MX_46b	0.0	Cup B because it is just double.
MX.46b.385.1	MX_46b	1.0	Because they are equally concentrated and they both have some of water.
MX.46b.399.1	MX_46b	2.0	There is 2 times as much of the same solution in B as in A therefore equal volumes would weigh the same.
MX.46b.455.1	MX_46b	1.0	Taking 50 milliliters from solution B would equal solution A.
MX.46b.525.1	MX_46b	0.0	Solution B is just double solution A.
