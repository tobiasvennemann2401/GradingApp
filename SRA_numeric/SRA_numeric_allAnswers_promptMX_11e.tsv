MX.11e.143.1	MX_11e	0.0	He could use a paper filter decided what he is using or a screen.
MX.11e.176.1	MX_11e	0.0	He could get a filter and pour the solution into to it with a cup under.
MX.11e.248.1	MX_11e	0.0	Jim could separate dissolved water by using a filter. The water turns clear.
MX.11e.261.1	MX_11e	1.0	Let it evaporate.
MX.11e.347.1	MX_11e	1.0	Get a filter paper and pour the dissolve mixture and the solid will stay in the filter.
MX.11e.364.1	MX_11e	0.0	The solid will maybe dry up and water will stay the same.
MX.11e.366.1	MX_11e	0.0	It dissolves and weigh 100 milliliters still.
MX.11e.393.1	MX_11e	1.0	Jim could evaporate the solution. The water would go into the air and turn into a gas but the salt would stay behind.
MX.11e.396.1	MX_11e	1.0	He can evaporate mixture one. The water would become a gas and some kind of crystal would be left.
MX.11e.419.1	MX_11e	0.0	He could filter it and the solid could be in the filter and the water could be in the cup.
MX.11e.426.1	MX_11e	2.0	He could put in a evaporation tray and see the solid material!
MX.11e.432.1	MX_11e	1.0	Evaporate the water so there is just the solid.
MX.11e.438.1	MX_11e	1.0	He could evaporate the solution, the water would evaporate and the solid will be left behind.
MX.11e.452.1	MX_11e	1.0	It could evaporate the water from the salt. The solid crystallized and the water turned into a gas called water vapor.
MX.11e.455.1	MX_11e	2.0	Pour the solution into evaporating dishes. The water evaporates, or turns into a gas, and the solid crystallizes.
MX.11e.457.1	MX_11e	1.0	He could evaporate the solution and the water would be in the air and the solid would be in the container.
MX.11e.459.1	MX_11e	1.0	It dissolves into the air bubble.
MX.11e.464.1	MX_11e	1.0	Evaporate. The solid would crystallize, and the water would become vapor and go into the clouds.
MX.11e.467.1	MX_11e	1.0	Put the solution in an evaporation plate and let it dissolve.
MX.11e.468.1	MX_11e	0.0	You can get a coffee filter you pour it in the you wait for it to seep into the coffee filter.
MX.11e.471.1	MX_11e	0.0	Jim could use a coffee filter to separate the solid from the water. Now the water and the solid are separated.
MX.11e.491.1	MX_11e	1.0	Jim could evaporate the solution.
MX.11e.496.1	MX_11e	0.0	He could filter out the dissolved with a dry filter. And the water will be in its own cup.
MX.11e.497.1	MX_11e	1.0	He could filter out the solid. Or evaporate the water.
MX.11e.502.1	MX_11e	0.0	Evaporate the solute. The water dissolves and the solute will turn into crystals.
MX.11e.527.1	MX_11e	1.0	You could let the water evaporate and there will probably be something left over in the dish or cup.
MX.11e.541.1	MX_11e	0.0	He can use a filter.
MX.11e.564.1	MX_11e	0.0	He could take a filter, 2 cups, and put one under the filter paper and pour it through. So the solid would end up in the filter and the water in the cup.
MX.11e.566.1	MX_11e	2.0	Jim could put the solution in an evaporation dish and the solid will be the crystals and the water will evaporate.
MX.11e.574.1	MX_11e	0.0	First he could take a wet filter paper, put a clear cup with nothing in it underneath it, then pour the solution through the filter paper.
MX.11e.592.1	MX_11e	2.0	Jim could pour the water onto a plate and have the water evaporate and the solid will crystallize.
MX.11e.605.1	MX_11e	0.0	You could not do it.
MX.11e.635.1	MX_11e	0.0	Use a filter to separate the. The solid will stay in filter and water will just go through.
MX.11e.638.1	MX_11e	0.0	1. Take a paper filter. 2. Get the filter wet. 3. Pour the mixture in. 4. Let the filter dry. 5. The mixture is separated.
MX.11e.640.1	MX_11e	0.0	He could put it through a filter and then he would be able to see the crystals.
MX.11e.304.1	MX_11e	0.0	You use a filter to separate the solid and the water in a cup the solid stays on the filter and the water goes through.
MX.11e.559.1	MX_11e	2.0	He could evaporate the water and then the solid will turn into crystals.
MX.11e.571.1	MX_11e	0.0	He could put the solution through filter paper and separated the solute and the solvent.
MX.11e.637.1	MX_11e	0.0	Filter the solution and the salt, dissolved salt, will stay on the filter and the water will just go back in the cup.
