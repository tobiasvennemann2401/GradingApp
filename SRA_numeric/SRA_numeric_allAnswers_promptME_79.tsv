ME.79.107.1	ME_79	2.0	The magnet magnetized the first one, then it a temporary magnet and then the next one.
ME.79.111.1	ME_79	1.0	He magnetized it for a minute.
ME.79.113.1	ME_79	1.0	Because it lets magnetism through the paperclips.
ME.79.120.1	ME_79	2.0	He was able to do that because the magnetism traveled through the paperclips.
ME.79.123.1	ME_79	2.0	The magnetism went through the first paperclip to the rest.
ME.79.140.1	ME_79	1.0	When you pick up a object that object acts like it is a magnet.
ME.79.141.1	ME_79	2.0	Because if the magnet touches the one paperclip became a temporary magnet and when another paperclip hooked that other paperclip worked like a magnet.
ME.79.142.1	ME_79	1.0	The magnet's force go through the first paperclip to the last paperclip.
ME.79.148.1	ME_79	2.0	When the first paperclip touched the magnet it became a temporary magnet that is what happened to each of the paperclips as it touched the one before it.
ME.79.152.1	ME_79	2.0	The magnet was turning the paperclips into temporary magnets.
ME.79.154.1	ME_79	2.0	It was possible because the magnetic force from the magnet ran through the first paperclip almost making that paperclip like a magnet so it was able to pick up more.
ME.79.155.1	ME_79	0.0	Kurt you were able to pick up that magnet because the energy of the first one was able to pick up more because of the energy.
ME.79.159.1	ME_79	1.0	The magnetism is going through the paperclips.
ME.79.173.1	ME_79	1.0	He rubs the paperclip on the magnet and it flow power through one, 2, 3 paperclips.
ME.79.174.1	ME_79	2.0	Kurt was able to pick up all those paperclips because they are iron and magnetism can flow through iron.
ME.79.180.1	ME_79	2.0	It was able to pick up all the rest because the magnetism flow through the paperclips.
ME.79.185.1	ME_79	1.0	He is able to by letting the force go through the paperclips and making them all attract not repel because hand makes a repel and that is a magnetism of science.
ME.79.190.1	ME_79	1.0	He was able to because the magnetism was going through the paperclip.
ME.79.191.1	ME_79	0.0	Well it can do that because the florescent is flowing through all of the paperclips, that is why.
ME.79.195.1	ME_79	1.0	The magnetism goes through the paperclip.
ME.79.206.1	ME_79	1.0	The magnetism force flows through the paperclips.
ME.79.207.1	ME_79	1.0	The magnet sends magnet through one paperclip to another.
ME.79.208.1	ME_79	1.0	The magnetic force went through the paperclips.
ME.79.212.1	ME_79	1.0	The magnetic force flows through all the paperclips.
ME.79.214.1	ME_79	2.0	He was able to do that because the magnetic force flows through the paperclips and creates a temporary magnet.
ME.79.216.1	ME_79	1.0	The magnet made the paperclips stick on because the magnetism flowing through.
ME.79.217.1	ME_79	0.0	The magnet has enough power.
ME.79.224.1	ME_79	1.0	It picked it up because the paperclips was a magnet.
ME.79.226.1	ME_79	1.0	The magnet hook all of those paperclips together because the magnetic electricity travels through the paperclips.
ME.79.228.1	ME_79	1.0	The force went through the paperclips so that made it able to pick up all those paperclips.
ME.79.245.1	ME_79	2.0	He did that because the magnet has a lot of power so it picked up on paperclip then that paperclip is a temporary magnet and passes the power.
ME.79.250.1	ME_79	1.0	The magnet has enough power to pick up more things. What happens is the magnetic field goes around and the clips sticks to clip and then that clips up another and so forth.
ME.79.284.1	ME_79	1.0	They could pick up paperclips because the magnetism went through the paperclips.
ME.79.311.1	ME_79	0.0	It is flowing though the magnet so it works.
ME.79.314.1	ME_79	0.0	The first paperclips gets strong and give it to these conduct and they are one.
ME.79.324.1	ME_79	2.0	The paperclip is attaching like a temporary magnet.
ME.79.178.1	ME_79	0.0	The magnet has more power so it is able to hold more.
ME.79.181.1	ME_79	0.0	Because the magnetism is flowing.
ME.79.254.1	ME_79	2.0	Dear Kurt, that paperclip became a temporary magnet that is why you could pick up 3 magnets.
ME.79.327.1	ME_79	1.0	It is an induced magnetism.
