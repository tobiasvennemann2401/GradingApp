MX.10.387.1	MX_10	1.0	Jorge knew a chemical reaction was occurred because it started bubble.
MX.10.390.1	MX_10	1.0	Because the mixture bubbled.
MX.10.396.1	MX_10	2.0	Because gas being formed can be a sign of a chemical reaction.
MX.10.400.1	MX_10	2.0	Because he knew the bubbles meant carbon dioxide was being formed.
MX.10.419.1	MX_10	2.0	Because the balloon expanded and filled with gas and it bubbled up.
MX.10.421.1	MX_10	2.0	Because it started to bubble or to fizz and it is the proof of gas.
MX.10.423.1	MX_10	1.0	Because when it bubbles that means a reaction is taking place.
MX.10.425.1	MX_10	1.0	Because bubbling is a sign of a chemical reaction.
MX.10.429.1	MX_10	1.0	Because it bubbled.
MX.10.434.1	MX_10	1.0	Because the solution began to bubble.
MX.10.435.1	MX_10	1.0	Because whenever it fizzes or bubbles that means it is a reaction.
MX.10.436.1	MX_10	2.0	Because the bubbles appear it makes a gas.
MX.10.453.1	MX_10	1.0	He knew because there are bubbles in the container.
MX.10.458.1	MX_10	1.0	Bubble.
MX.10.462.1	MX_10	2.0	Because gas bubbles appeared.
MX.10.463.1	MX_10	2.0	He knew because first he put a material in the water and started to bubble and that made gas so that is a clue of a chemical reaction.
MX.10.466.1	MX_10	2.0	Because there were gas bubbles.
MX.10.468.1	MX_10	1.0	Because he saw it bubble up that is why he knew it was a chemical reaction.
MX.10.492.1	MX_10	1.0	When he put the solid in the liquid it start to bubbles.
MX.10.493.1	MX_10	1.0	Because it bubbled and fizz.
MX.10.498.1	MX_10	1.0	Because it bubbled and when something bubbled it means a reaction occurred.
MX.10.502.1	MX_10	1.0	Because the solution bubbled.
MX.10.532.1	MX_10	1.0	I think it is because it started to bubble and because it would not do that if it was not a reaction.
MX.10.541.1	MX_10	1.0	He knew because it bubbled.
MX.10.543.1	MX_10	1.0	Jorge knew a chemical reaction occurred, because the mixture began to bubble.
MX.10.568.1	MX_10	2.0	He knew because a change occurred and it made a gas.
MX.10.575.1	MX_10	2.0	He knew because when bubbles pop a gas is released into the air.
MX.10.576.1	MX_10	2.0	Because it was making gas, it was fizzing, it made some precipitant.
MX.10.597.1	MX_10	1.0	Because the solution started to bubble.
MX.10.604.1	MX_10	1.0	Because the container started to bubble up.
MX.10.605.1	MX_10	1.0	Because he saw it fizz and bubble up.
MX.10.611.1	MX_10	1.0	Because bubble appeared when he add the solid material.
MX.10.612.1	MX_10	1.0	Because it bubbled and if it bubbles then it is a reaction.
MX.10.633.1	MX_10	0.0	A chemical reaction is when something happens if you add a material and a liquid together and something happens it is a chemical reaction.
MX.10.638.1	MX_10	2.0	Because it started to bubble and have a gas.
MX.10.644.1	MX_10	1.0	Because his experiment took action right away with no waiting.
MX.10.389.1	MX_10	0.0	Because it was bubbly.
MX.10.431.1	MX_10	0.0	Because it bubbled.
MX.10.564.1	MX_10	2.0	Jorge knew that because it was bubbly and when it bubbly it means it is gas.
MX.10.574.1	MX_10	2.0	Because once the 2 chemicals mixed the solution started to react by fizzing bubble.
