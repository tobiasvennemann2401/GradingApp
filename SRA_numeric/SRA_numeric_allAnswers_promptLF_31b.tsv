LF.31b.384.1	LF_31b	1.0	Like a small river getting big, deltas are formed when a regular river is out to a ocean or lake. Over time the water will erode the mouth into a fan shaped deposit.
LF.31b.387.1	LF_31b	1.0	A river rock earth motional with it and deposits it at the mouth. There is forming a delta.
LF.31b.397.1	LF_31b	0.0	Deltas are earth materials that are carried away by the river and settle.
LF.31b.404.1	LF_31b	1.0	A delta forms at the mouth of a river when earth material is carried away in a river.
LF.31b.407.1	LF_31b	1.0	They come from water and water just keeps on building up.
LF.31b.408.1	LF_31b	1.0	A erosion happen and over the time it forms.
LF.31b.409.1	LF_31b	0.0	The depositions collapsing into them.
LF.31b.416.1	LF_31b	1.0	It forms by a deposit of earth materials at mouth of a stream or river.
LF.31b.417.1	LF_31b	1.0	Deltas are formed because the water takes the sand to the end of the river where it piles up and forms a delta.
LF.31b.419.1	LF_31b	1.0	Delta forms by water or a river.
LF.31b.422.1	LF_31b	1.0	Delta is formed because the mouth is full of water or melted ice.
LF.31b.427.1	LF_31b	1.0	It is formed by a mouth of river of stream.
LF.31b.427b.1	LF_31b	1.0	It is formed by amount river or stream.
LF.31b.428.1	LF_31b	1.0	Deltas form by depositions with water.
LF.31b.432.1	LF_31b	1.0	A deposition at the mouth of the river.
LF.31b.440.1	LF_31b	1.0	A delta is formed when water is deposited.
LF.31b.457.1	LF_31b	1.0	Delta is form by different kinds of rock and gravity.
LF.31b.459.1	LF_31b	0.0	I pick gravity because gravity is like process.
LF.31b.462.1	LF_31b	0.0	It forms with gravity because it is like metal and plastic.
LF.31b.476.1	LF_31b	1.0	By earth materials moving then stopping where the delta is.
LF.31b.480.1	LF_31b	1.0	By running water.
LF.31b.489.1	LF_31b	1.0	As the water from the mountain comes and invades the place, it starts the canyon then it meanders around until it comes to another larger body of water and the delta is the end of the lake and beginning of the lake.
LF.31b.513.1	LF_31b	1.0	A canyon is formed and the water pushes the dirt and other materials into a fan shape.
LF.31b.527.1	LF_31b	1.0	Deltas are form by erosion and deposition.
LF.31b.677.1	LF_31b	1.0	Earth materials are carried by water and dropped under the water settling at the bottom of the river.
LF.31b.680.1	LF_31b	1.0	Deltas are formed by deposition that is when earth materials are carried away then let off at another place to form a delta.
LF.31b.682.1	LF_31b	1.0	Deltas form when water is run over a plateau for a long period of time and when the water runs somewhere else, that place where it runs out is a delta.
LF.31b.780.1	LF_31b	2.0	A delta forms whenever a river picks up dirt, sand and clay and carries them to the mouth of the river were it is weakened so it drops the materials and forms a delta.
LF.31b.788.1	LF_31b	1.0	Deltas are formed by water carrying earth materials and not have enough force to push the materials so it lets the materials go.
LF.31b.803.1	LF_31b	2.0	It forms when a river goes to a larger part of water and it leaves particles behind.
LF.31b.822.1	LF_31b	2.0	Sand gets carried away by the river and settles at the mouth and forms a delta.
LF.31b.844.1	LF_31b	1.0	A delta is formed when flowing water pushes sand to opposite sides forming a delta.
LF.31b.853.1	LF_31b	1.0	Deltas form by rivers flowing and pushing sediment to the side.
LF.31b.922.1	LF_31b	1.0	Deltas form by water running over it.
LF.31b.389.1	LF_31b	1.0	Water pushes sand to make a slope.
LF.31b.410.1	LF_31b	1.0	By erosion.
LF.31b.526.1	LF_31b	1.0	Deltas are formed by erosion and deposition.
LF.31b.827.1	LF_31b	1.0	Deltas form by the water wearing down the mouth and dragging it down.
