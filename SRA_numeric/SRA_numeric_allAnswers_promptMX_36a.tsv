MX.36a.136.1	MX_36a	0.0	Because first she put eggshells then the next day she made a solution.
MX.36a.146.1	MX_36a	0.0	Because bubble came out of the eggshell.
MX.36a.151.1	MX_36a	2.0	I think she made a solution because the eggshells and bubbles disappeared.
MX.36a.185.1	MX_36a	2.0	She made a solution because she said that the water was clear and that is a solution.
MX.36a.248.1	MX_36a	0.0	I think she did a solution because it had bubbles.
MX.36a.261.1	MX_36a	2.0	Because the eggshells were gone.
MX.36a.285.1	MX_36a	1.0	Because it was clear.
MX.36a.304.1	MX_36a	1.0	That is because a solution is clear that you could see through.
MX.36a.359.1	MX_36a	2.0	She made a solution because the eggshells had disappeared and it cannot be separated.
MX.36a.364.1	MX_36a	2.0	Because the eggshells were gone and the water was left, inside was clear that why she thinks that she made a solution.
MX.36a.385.1	MX_36a	0.0	It was a reaction because it fizz and bubble up.
MX.36a.392.1	MX_36a	2.0	The mixture was clear and eggshell was gone.
MX.36a.393.1	MX_36a	0.0	Because bubbles are one sign of a gas.
MX.36a.419.1	MX_36a	2.0	She thinks she made a solution because the eggshell dissolved in the vinegar and bubbled up and turned clear.
MX.36a.432.1	MX_36a	2.0	Because the eggshell was gone and it was clear.
MX.36a.437.1	MX_36a	1.0	Grace mixed 2 materials together and the solution ended up clear.
MX.36a.439.1	MX_36a	1.0	Because she thinks that the eggshells and the water reaction and she think during the reaction the eggshell dissolved.
MX.36a.453.1	MX_36a	2.0	She thinks she made a solution because the solute dissolved and the water is clear.
MX.36a.469.1	MX_36a	2.0	Grace thinks she made a solution because first she put eggshells into a cup and covered them up with vinegar and then small bubbles appeared on the surface of the eggshell and a couple of days the eggshells were gone and the liquid was clear.
MX.36a.473.1	MX_36a	1.0	Yes because she saw the gas on and the vinegar was clear.
MX.36a.496.1	MX_36a	0.0	Because a solution is when a solute and a solvent are mixed and she did that.
MX.36a.503.1	MX_36a	2.0	Because she put eggshells in a cup and covered them with vinegar and after a couple of days she saw that they were gone.
MX.36a.504.1	MX_36a	1.0	The eggshells dissolved a solution is when the solvent dissolve.
MX.36a.531.1	MX_36a	0.0	The vinegar destroyed the eggshells.
MX.36a.540.1	MX_36a	0.0	Because he used something that can make it bubble.
MX.36a.543.1	MX_36a	0.0	I think Grace thinks she made a solution because she mixed eggshells and vinegar together.
MX.36a.562.1	MX_36a	2.0	Because at the end the eggshell was gone and the water was clear.
MX.36a.568.1	MX_36a	2.0	Grace thinks she made a solution because the eggshells disappeared into the liquid.
MX.36a.571.1	MX_36a	2.0	I think the reason why Grace thinks she made a solution is because the eggshells went away after awhile.
MX.36a.572.1	MX_36a	2.0	I think she did make a solution because a solution is when 2 or more materials are mixed together and one disappears into the other.
MX.36a.576.1	MX_36a	1.0	Because it turned into a clear liquid solution.
MX.36a.592.1	MX_36a	1.0	She thinks the water was clear, which it was so it was a solution.
MX.36a.596.1	MX_36a	0.0	Because there were more bubbles everyday.
MX.36a.601.1	MX_36a	2.0	Because she said the water was clear. When water is clear then it is a solution.
MX.36a.626.1	MX_36a	2.0	It is a solution because the eggshells disappeared leaving liquid clear making a solution.
MX.36a.635.1	MX_36a	2.0	Because she mixed the vinegar with the eggshells and later bubbles started to show up then it cleared.
MX.36a.126.1	MX_36a	0.0	She make a solution because she put eggshells into the cup and covered.
MX.36a.176.1	MX_36a	0.0	Because when she found it was.
MX.36a.572b.1	MX_36a	1.0	She made a solution because she did eggshells and vinegar. Vinegar makes stuff bubble.
MX.36a.608.1	MX_36a	1.0	Because something dissolved and stuff.
