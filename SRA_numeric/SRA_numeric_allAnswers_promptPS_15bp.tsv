PS.15bp.194.1	PS_15bp	0.0	The low has make the highest sound and the highest make the lower sound.
PS.15bp.212.1	PS_15bp	2.0	It is so big it has a lot of room to vibrate.
PS.15bp.222.1	PS_15bp	2.0	Because the sound has more room to vibrate.
PS.15bp.249.1	PS_15bp	2.0	The bigger it is the lower the sound the smaller it is the higher the sound.
PS.15bp.255.1	PS_15bp	0.0	Because it has more amplification.
PS.15bp.320.1	PS_15bp	2.0	Because it is the biggest.
PS.15bp.384.1	PS_15bp	0.0	Because it has a little hole.
PS.15bp.452.1	PS_15bp	1.0	Because it is the longest and it takes a while for it to make sound.
PS.15bp.457.1	PS_15bp	1.0	It makes the lowest sound because it vibrates slower from having to travel far.
PS.15bp.461.1	PS_15bp	2.0	Because it is the biggest out of all the instruments.
PS.15bp.486.1	PS_15bp	1.0	Because the instrument is thicker than the others.
PS.15bp.494.1	PS_15bp	0.0	Because the lower it is the lower for big.
PS.15bp.502.1	PS_15bp	2.0	Because the sound waves had a short time to set to the bottom, because it is bigger.
PS.15bp.524.1	PS_15bp	1.0	Because it has to travel longer.
PS.15bp.532.1	PS_15bp	2.0	It makes the lowest sound because it is bigger and vibrates slower.
PS.15bp.539.1	PS_15bp	1.0	This is why it makes the lower sound the one I circled goes down and then up that might be why.
PS.15bp.562.1	PS_15bp	2.0	I think that is the correct answer because is bigger.
PS.15bp.567.1	PS_15bp	2.0	Because it is a big one so it is going to make the lowest sound.
PS.15bp.571.1	PS_15bp	2.0	Because if it is large then it makes a lower sound.
PS.15bp.593.1	PS_15bp	2.0	Because the bigger it is the lower the sound gets.
PS.15bp.605.1	PS_15bp	1.0	Because it is the longest instrument. The air takes a longer time to travel out.
PS.15bp.629.1	PS_15bp	1.0	Because it has the longest way to travel.
PS.15bp.641.1	PS_15bp	0.0	Because is little instruments and I already played it once.
PS.15b.230.1	PS_15bp	2.0	Because the bigger it is the lower the sound.
PS.15b.393.1	PS_15bp	0.0	I think it makes a low sound because it has a little hole so the sound can get through.
PS.15b.602.1	PS_15bp	1.0	Because it has to travel a long distance.
PS.15b.644.1	PS_15bp	1.0	The sound goes a long distance.
