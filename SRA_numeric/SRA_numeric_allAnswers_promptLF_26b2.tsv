LF.26b2.393.1	LF_26b2	1.0	As the contour lines get closer the mountain side gets steeper.
LF.26b2.403.1	LF_26b2	1.0	The lines are close together.
LF.26b2.408.1	LF_26b2	0.0	You can tell because it is at the top and it is 5000.
LF.26b2.416.1	LF_26b2	1.0	Because the contour lines are closer than the others.
LF.26b2.417.1	LF_26b2	1.0	I can tell because the contour lines closer.
LF.26b2.421.1	LF_26b2	0.0	S because it is closer together.
LF.26b2.430.1	LF_26b2	0.0	It is steeper because it is below sea level.
LF.26b2.433.1	LF_26b2	0.0	Because it looks like it is going further down than the others.
LF.26b2.436.1	LF_26b2	2.0	How do I know it is the steepest because the lines are closer.
LF.26b2.445.1	LF_26b2	0.0	I know because Q is at the bottom of the map.
LF.26b2.446.1	LF_26b2	1.0	Because the line is closer.
LF.26b2.464.1	LF_26b2	1.0	Because it has a line in it and probably it is a valley or something.
LF.26b2.476.1	LF_26b2	1.0	Because the contour lines are close to each other.
LF.26b2.477.1	LF_26b2	1.0	Because you can see that her lines has the top and it is steeper.
LF.26b2.479.1	LF_26b2	0.0	Because it is in the middle and it is steeper.
LF.26b2.486.1	LF_26b2	2.0	Q is the steepest part of the map the line is close together.
LF.26b2.492.1	LF_26b2	0.0	Because Q is moving like a snake and it is hard to go swirl like this.
LF.26b2.511.1	LF_26b2	2.0	Q. Because the contour lines are closer together to make it steeper.
LF.26b2.527.1	LF_26b2	0.0	Because it curves going up the mountain.
LF.26b2.531.1	LF_26b2	2.0	Because the contour lines are closer together than the other R and S.
LF.26b2.537.1	LF_26b2	0.0	Because the elevation increases and does not decrease.
LF.26b2.680.1	LF_26b2	1.0	I know because the contour lines are closer together.
LF.26b2.708.1	LF_26b2	1.0	Because the lines are closer together.
LF.26b2.717.1	LF_26b2	1.0	The land lines are close.
LF.26b2.740.1	LF_26b2	1.0	The lines are closer together.
LF.26b2.743.1	LF_26b2	0.0	Because it is the straightest part.
LF.26b2.778.1	LF_26b2	2.0	The contour lines are closer together.
LF.26b2.786.1	LF_26b2	1.0	I know because the contour lines are closer together.
LF.26b2.802.1	LF_26b2	2.0	I know it is the steepest part because the contour lines are closer together.
LF.26b2.808.1	LF_26b2	1.0	The contour lines are close together.
LF.26b2.814.1	LF_26b2	2.0	I know it is the steepest part of the trail because the lines are the closest together.
LF.26b2.823.1	LF_26b2	1.0	Because the contour lines are closer.
LF.26b2.838.1	LF_26b2	0.0	Q because the place it is located.
LF.26b2.839.1	LF_26b2	2.0	Q is on the steepest part of the trail. I know this because the lines are closer together.
LF.26b2.846.1	LF_26b2	1.0	The contour lines are close together.
LF.26b2.922.1	LF_26b2	2.0	I know it is the steepest trail because the lines are close together.
LF.26b2.468.1	LF_26b2	2.0	I know because the contour lines are smaller.
LF.26b2.661.1	LF_26b2	1.0	I Think this because for Q the mountains steepness 5000 and Q is very close.
LF.26b2.776.1	LF_26b2	2.0	The contour lines are closer together.
LF.26b2.845.1	LF_26b2	2.0	I know this by on the Q side the lines are closer together so they are steeper.
