SE.4a.107.1	SE_4a	1.0	The cement is heat sink and the wood is heat sink.
SE.4a.109.1	SE_4a	1.0	Something that could hold energy.
SE.4a.123.1	SE_4a	2.0	A heat sink is an object that can attract heat.
SE.4a.126.1	SE_4a	2.0	Heat sink is anything that gets or contains heat.
SE.4a.144.1	SE_4a	0.0	It is when the sun absorbs the water from the sand.
SE.4a.159.1	SE_4a	2.0	A heat sink is something that traps heat in. Like water it heats up and traps the heat to make boiling water.
SE.4a.174.1	SE_4a	0.0	A heat sink is a temperature the water heats up very slowly.
SE.4a.175.1	SE_4a	1.0	A heat sink heats up slowly and cools down slowly.
SE.4a.182.1	SE_4a	2.0	A heat sink is a material that can hold a lot of heats. Heat sink heats up materials.
SE.4a.184.1	SE_4a	0.0	A heat sink is water that heats up more slowly and cools down more slowly than earth dry materials.
SE.4a.190.1	SE_4a	0.0	When the temperature in the thermometer goes down or decreases.
SE.4a.191.1	SE_4a	2.0	Something that absorbs heat and loses heat slow like water.
SE.4a.261.1	SE_4a	1.0	It is something like dry soil.
SE.4a.311.1	SE_4a	0.0	It is an earth material that takes energy and releases it slowly.
SE.4a.314.1	SE_4a	0.0	It is an earth material that absorbs energy slowly and releases it slowly.
SE.4a.316.1	SE_4a	0.0	A heat sink is an earth material that absorbs energy slowly and releases it slowly.
SE.4a.382.1	SE_4a	2.0	It is a material that decreases heat such as water.
SE.4a.384.1	SE_4a	0.0	When the temperature drops.
SE.4a.396.1	SE_4a	0.0	When the heat starts to go down.
SE.4a.405.1	SE_4a	1.0	It is a material that may lower heat.
SE.4a.408.1	SE_4a	0.0	When the temperature drops.
SE.4a.409.1	SE_4a	2.0	A heat sink is something that absorbs sunlight quickly. Water is the best heat sink.
SE.4a.429.1	SE_4a	0.0	Heat sink is when the temperature drops.
SE.4a.441.1	SE_4a	0.0	A heat sink is when a temperature goes up just a little or down a little.
SE.4a.443.1	SE_4a	2.0	A heat sink is material that takes in more heat.
SE.4a.487.1	SE_4a	2.0	Something that can absorb heat.
SE.4a.493.1	SE_4a	2.0	A substance that can take in and give off heat.
