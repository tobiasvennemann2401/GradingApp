MX.11b.140.1	MX_11b	2.0	Mixture 4 and 5 because it has the precipitate at the bottom of the cup.
MX.11b.143.1	MX_11b	2.0	4 and 5 because you see material on bottom.
MX.11b.248.1	MX_11b	1.0	The ones that are saturated are mixtures 4, 5.
MX.11b.255.1	MX_11b	0.0	Clear nothing on bottom.
MX.11b.285.1	MX_11b	0.0	It is chemical reaction.
MX.11b.356.1	MX_11b	2.0	Mixtures 4 and 5 are saturate because there is material on bottom.
MX.11b.384.1	MX_11b	2.0	Solution 4 and solution 5. The cup has material on the bottom.
MX.11b.388.1	MX_11b	2.0	4 and 5 are saturated because there is material on the bottom that will not dissolve.
MX.11b.389.1	MX_11b	2.0	Solution 4, 5. Saturation is when you can see some material on the bottom.
MX.11b.390.1	MX_11b	2.0	4 and 5 because there is material on the bottom.
MX.11b.394.1	MX_11b	2.0	Mixture 4 and mixture 5 are saturated. When water cannot hold any more of a solid, when you try to add more, it falls to the bottom. That happened in both mixture 4 and 5 so they are both saturated.
MX.11b.419.1	MX_11b	0.0	I forgot what that means.
MX.11b.421.1	MX_11b	2.0	Mixture 4 and mixture 5. It is when particles is sitting at the bottom.
MX.11b.422.1	MX_11b	2.0	Mixture 4 and 5 are both saturated because they have material on the bottom.
MX.11b.429.1	MX_11b	0.0	Mixture one, 2, and 3 because they are clean on the bottom.
MX.11b.432.1	MX_11b	2.0	4 and 5 because there stuff on the bottom.
MX.11b.452.1	MX_11b	2.0	Mixture 4 and 5 because there is no more space to dissolve so it is saturated.
MX.11b.454.1	MX_11b	2.0	4 and 5 are saturated because there is solid on the bottom.
MX.11b.463.1	MX_11b	2.0	4 and 5 because he has clear water and material on the bottom.
MX.11b.467.1	MX_11b	2.0	4 and 5 because there is stuff at the bottom.
MX.11b.468.1	MX_11b	2.0	Material 4, 5 has stuff on the bottom.
MX.11b.471.1	MX_11b	2.0	4 and 5. There is material on the bottom.
MX.11b.473.1	MX_11b	2.0	Solution 4, 5 has some material.
MX.11b.489.1	MX_11b	2.0	4 and 5 because they have material on the bottom.
MX.11b.492.1	MX_11b	2.0	4 and 5 are saturated because there stuff on the bottom.
MX.11b.494.1	MX_11b	2.0	4 and 5 are saturated because that is solid at the bottom.
MX.11b.495.1	MX_11b	2.0	Mixture 4 and 5 because there is material at the bottom.
MX.11b.497.1	MX_11b	2.0	4 and 5 because there is a solid at the bottom.
MX.11b.498.1	MX_11b	2.0	Cup 4 and 5 they are the material at the bottom so they are saturated.
MX.11b.501.1	MX_11b	2.0	Mixtures 4 and 5, the evidence is that there is material at the bottom and that means it is saturated.
MX.11b.502.1	MX_11b	2.0	4 and 5. Material on the bottom.
MX.11b.532.1	MX_11b	1.0	I think mixture 4 mixtures are.
MX.11b.557.1	MX_11b	2.0	Mixture 4 and 5. The material at the bottom.
MX.11b.562.1	MX_11b	0.0	Mixture one and 3 because they are both clear and have no particles on the bottom.
MX.11b.569.1	MX_11b	2.0	Solution 4 and 5 because there is material on the bottom.
MX.11b.602.1	MX_11b	2.0	Saturation means stuff at the bottom.
MX.11b.604.1	MX_11b	2.0	4, 5 there is solid at the bottom.
MX.11b.612.1	MX_11b	2.0	A mixture that still has stuff at the bottom.
MX.11b.644.1	MX_11b	0.0	None because I do not think solid and water make a solution.
MX.11b.961.1	MX_11b	0.0	Solutions one and 3.
