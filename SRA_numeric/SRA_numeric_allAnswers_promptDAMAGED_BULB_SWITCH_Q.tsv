SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb35-l1.qa81	DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q	2.0	They are functionally the same.
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb36-l1.qa81	DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q	2.0	the damaged bulb does the same thing as an open switch by creating a gap but the damaged bulb cannot fix its self to recreate the current as a switch can turn the current on and off.
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb37-l1.qa81	DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q	1.0	"The both don""t work"
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb38-l1.qa82	DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q	1.0	Both a damaged bulb and open switch will disconnect the circuit.
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb40-l1.qa81	DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q	2.0	They are the same because they create a gap.
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb41-l1.qa82	DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q	0.0	An open switch means a closed pathway, where as a damaged bulb means a gap, and they both cause the circuit not to work properly.
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb42-l1.qa82	DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q	2.0	it creates the same effect
