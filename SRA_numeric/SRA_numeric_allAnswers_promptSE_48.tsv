SE.48.104.1	SE_48	1.0	C. When there are more than one thing it get hotter faster and cooler faster too.
SE.48.105.1	SE_48	1.0	C. Because there are more black in it.
SE.48.107.1	SE_48	1.0	C. It got more energy to do.
SE.48.117.1	SE_48	1.0	C. Because the more the black, the hotter it gets. The less it has, the cooler it gets.
SE.48.126.1	SE_48	2.0	C. The one with 3 disks could of got hot because it had more disks than A or B. Since it has more disks then it was the one that got the hottest because the sun heat got in it more than the other 2.
SE.48.136.1	SE_48	2.0	C. C because it holds 3 black papers in the pan with water facing the sun. Black absorbs the heat.
SE.48.140.1	SE_48	2.0	C. Since more surface area absorbs heat and it was black it makes more sense for it to be more hot.
SE.48.173.1	SE_48	2.0	C. I selected pan C because pan C got the most black disks so pan C absorbs more heat.
SE.48.247.1	SE_48	1.0	C. There is more black to attract the sun.
SE.48.251.1	SE_48	0.0	A. Because B and C will take too long to heat up because there is more water in pan B and C.
SE.48.252.1	SE_48	0.0	C. Because there are 3 white cakes in pan C.
SE.48.253.1	SE_48	1.0	C. Because it has more black circles.
SE.48.257.1	SE_48	1.0	C. It has more black and black heats up fast.
SE.48.261.1	SE_48	1.0	C. I picked C because it has more pans and they will affect the sun.
SE.48.267.1	SE_48	2.0	C. Because it has more black in it that attracts the sun to make it hotter.
SE.48.328.1	SE_48	1.0	C. I pick C because that is the highest of the other.
SE.48.386.1	SE_48	2.0	C. I think it would be the hottest because it has more black.
SE.48.387.1	SE_48	1.0	C. Because it has the most plastic disks.
SE.48.409.1	SE_48	1.0	C. The cake pan C had the most black in it so it warmed up the quickest and made the water warmer.
SE.48.424.1	SE_48	2.0	C. It has more black disks to absorb more heat.
SE.48.427.1	SE_48	2.0	C. Pan C had the largest surface area to absorb the heat from the sun, so pan C became the warmest pan in the sun.
SE.48.430.1	SE_48	1.0	C. Well it has more black, and the sun's heat is attracted by dark colors, so the heat would stay on C.
SE.48.440.1	SE_48	2.0	C. The black disks absorbs the heat so the width of the disk, the more the heats expands when it touches the water place will be heated up.
SE.48.441.1	SE_48	0.0	A. Water is a heat sink which slows down the absorption of the heat so the more water the less heat in the pan.
SE.48.488.1	SE_48	1.0	C. It has more black parts.
SE.48.490.1	SE_48	1.0	C. Because there are 3 heat sinks on C which will keep the pan warm in the night.
SE.48.492.1	SE_48	1.0	C. Because the more black it is the more the black is absorbing and making the water the hottest.
SE.48.493.1	SE_48	0.0	A. Because energy did not have much to heat so it focused on that one thing.
SE.48.502.1	SE_48	1.0	C. C, because there is more black in C than any other cake pan. The more black the hotter it will get because black absorbs the sun's energy.
SE.48.507.1	SE_48	2.0	C. They all absorbed the heat. When these disks they absorb and pass the heat between all of them and that is why.
SE.48.513.1	SE_48	1.0	C. Because the pan has more disks but they also are small so they would heat up easily.
SE.48.514.1	SE_48	2.0	C. Box C has the most surface area covered so all the plastic circles would absorb energy so it would be the warmest.
SE.48.532.1	SE_48	1.0	C. It has more black circles.
SE.48.548.1	SE_48	0.0	A. Because the pancake needed some room and it needs lots of tarp in order for it to have it cooked.
SE.48.592.1	SE_48	2.0	C. The one with 3 is hotter because more black absorbs more heat.
SE.48.615.1	SE_48	2.0	C. Pan C has more black disks so the heat will be absorbed because the more black there is the more heat is absorbed.
SE.48.385.1	SE_48	2.0	C. Because black absorbs heat and C has more black area so I think it is C.
SE.48.556.1	SE_48	2.0	C. Because it has the most black disks. Black absorbs heat.
SE.48.580.1	SE_48	2.0	C. I picked C because A and B only have one or 2 black plastic disks and that does not take as much heat. Also C has more black so it would be hotter because there is more black.
SE.48.608.1	SE_48	2.0	C. Pan C held the hottest water because pan C has a lot of black in it and black absorbs heat. Pan A and B have barely any black. There is more water showing and I know that since water is a heat sink it takes longer to heat up.
