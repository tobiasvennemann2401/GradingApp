VB.22c.381.1	VB_22c	2.0	When it get up to 3 scoops the mass of beans harvested decreases.
VB.22c.384.1	VB_22c	1.0	As the fertilizer increases the beans increase then decrease.
VB.22c.394.1	VB_22c	2.0	If you use anything under 3 scoops you will not get your greatest mass. If you use anything over 3 scoops you will also not get your greatest mass.
VB.22c.397.1	VB_22c	1.0	The more scoops of fertilizer the bigger they get. The more scoops of fertilizer the smaller they get.
VB.22c.404.1	VB_22c	1.0	As the scoops increase the mass increases until it gets too much fertilizer.
VB.22c.406.1	VB_22c	1.0	Once the third scoop is added you are good to go and not to use over 3 scoops.
VB.22c.416.1	VB_22c	1.0	It goes up until it gets to 3 it goes down all the way to 6.
VB.22c.419.1	VB_22c	0.0	It goes in a pattern like 0 is on 0.2 and like one is on 0.7 and goes from even to odd.
VB.22c.423.1	VB_22c	1.0	It tells me that the more water she puts in the plant the heavier it is.
VB.22c.429.1	VB_22c	1.0	The relationship between the number of scoops and the mass of beans is the heavier the bean the more scoops it needs to a plant. Beyond that point, the more scoops it gets the worse it is going to grow.
VB.22c.440.1	VB_22c	2.0	Well 3 is the perfect amount because 4 is too many 2 is not enough.
VB.22c.444.1	VB_22c	1.0	2 and 4 are both the same mass of beans harvest, they are both 1.2 mass.
VB.22c.448.1	VB_22c	1.0	Every time she put in scoops it went up until 3 scoops. Then it went down.
VB.22c.458.1	VB_22c	2.0	It shows that if you put 0 fertilizer then it is 2.0. If you did one scoop she got 0.7 and if you did 2 you got 1.2 and if you did 3 you get 1.5 and 4 is 1.2 5 is 0.5 6 is 0.0.
VB.22c.462.1	VB_22c	1.0	The graph shows you it keep going up until 4. At 4 probably makes the plant weak and then it keeps going down.
VB.22c.466.1	VB_22c	1.0	The relationship between the number of scoops of fertilizer and the mass of beans is that 2 scoops of fertilizer and 4 scoops of fertilizer equal 1.2 kilograms of beans.
VB.22c.475.1	VB_22c	0.0	The green tells you that the relationship between the scoops of fertilizer and mass of beans harvest kilograms, is that they each go apart different.
VB.22c.481.1	VB_22c	2.0	When Maya put too less fertilizer the beans weighed very little but when she started putting too much fertilizer the beans also started getting very light. They only time the beans were heavy was when she put 3 scoops. P S not too little not too much.
VB.22c.495.1	VB_22c	1.0	That the mass of the beans it got higher but the more heavier it got it went down.
VB.22c.497.1	VB_22c	1.0	That it is going up but at one point it stops and it goes low again.
VB.22c.498.1	VB_22c	1.0	The more scoops until 3 the more after that goes down.
VB.22c.503.1	VB_22c	1.0	It grows by the scoops get more then stops at a point and go back down.
VB.22c.506.1	VB_22c	1.0	It tells me how much Maya used the fertilizer to produce the greatest mass of bean.
VB.22c.521.1	VB_22c	0.0	It is going higher by the minute.
VB.22c.523.1	VB_22c	0.0	The graph tells us that she put a different mass of beans. And different scoops of fertilizer.
VB.22c.530.1	VB_22c	1.0	If she puts too much scoops it goes down if she puts about 3 she gets more.
VB.22c.533.1	VB_22c	1.0	When you put 3 it weighs more. If you put a lot like 6 the beans will be dead.
VB.22c.535.1	VB_22c	0.0	If there are the mass of the beans and the fertilizer they will be different.
VB.22c.542.1	VB_22c	0.0	The mass of beans harvested is getting bigger and higher.
VB.22c.545.1	VB_22c	0.0	The mass of beans harvested is getting bigger and the scoops of fertilizer is getting higher.
VB.22c.628.1	VB_22c	1.0	If you put 0 scoops 0.2 beans will come out. If you put 4 scoops 1.2 beans will come out.
VB.22c.632.1	VB_22c	1.0	0 scoops it got 0.2, one scoop got 0.7, 2 scoops it got 1.2, 3 scoops got 1.5, 4 scoops it got 1.2.
VB.22c.634.1	VB_22c	0.0	The lower the higher the higher the lower.
VB.22c.636.1	VB_22c	2.0	That if she puts 3 scoops the beans will have more mass and the more fertilizer the less mass it has.
VB.22c.638.1	VB_22c	1.0	The higher the scoops the more but just 3 and down.
VB.22c.648.1	VB_22c	1.0	At first it gets higher and higher but when it reaches 3 scoops it starts decreasing.
VB.22c.431.1	VB_22c	0.0	The more or less of fertilizer about the same mass it is.
VB.22c.452.1	VB_22c	1.0	The more you scoop you scoop, the higher, but if you get too deep the less you will get.
VB.22c.477.1	VB_22c	2.0	The relationship is that they had scoops of fertilizer numbered by 0, one, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and they have mass of beans numbered by 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, etcetera. Decimals going by 2's, so the relationship is that both scoops of fertilizer and mass of beans increases, and then decreases all together.
VB.22c.639.1	VB_22c	1.0	Too little scoops of fertilizer is too less but if you put too much it will weigh less as well. But if you put in not too much or not less is good.
