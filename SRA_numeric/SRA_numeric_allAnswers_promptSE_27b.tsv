SE.27b.109.1	SE_27b	1.0	No, because he is changing the temperature by putting his hand at the round part.
SE.27b.116.1	SE_27b	0.0	No, Because he will take some of the heat of the ball and if he does the temperature could go down 3 degrees.
SE.27b.117.1	SE_27b	1.0	No. Why, because the student who handled it might have been a different temperature which changes the temperature.
SE.27b.120.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, it would not read the same temperature because the heat on your hand heats the thermometer.
SE.27b.130.1	SE_27b	1.0	No, because the molecules might be moving too fast and then you fell sink.
SE.27b.131.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, No because the bulb will be hot and the degrees will go up. If it is on 20 Celsius it will go up to 30 Celsius.

SE.27b.139.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, The temperature will change when you hold the thermometer by the bulb because your hand and body is warm so the temperature will go high.
SE.27b.147.1	SE_27b	1.0	No, No because he keeps his thumb on the bulb of the bottom of the thermometer.
SE.27b.157.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, Because the boy's temperature is hot and the red liquid will go up.
SE.27b.159.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, It will change if hold it because you are heating the thermometer by the bulb.

SE.27b.191.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, It will not because they will be measuring finger temperature.
SE.27b.242.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, If you hold the bulb it would get hotter because some of the heat in your body will gain the thermometer.
SE.27b.243.1	SE_27b	1.0	No, Because of that student's body heat.
SE.27b.253.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, No because your fingers are hot. And it makes the water stuff inside go to different temperature.
SE.27b.254.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, If you hold the bottom of the thermometer the temperature will go up it give it more heat.
SE.27b.265.1	SE_27b	0.0	Yes, Well the alcohol needs the sun or shade to change the bulb of the thermometer, but if something or someone is blocking it, the alcohol will not go neither up nor down.
SE.27b.265b.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, I say no because when your body temperature is not the same as air temperature which makes it go up.
SE.27b.313.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, It will not be the same because it would absorb the heat and increase the number.
SE.27b.316.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, Because if a student had the thermometer by the bulb the thermometer would measure the temperature of his or her body not the object.
SE.27b.317.1	SE_27b	1.0	No, Because it is somewhere different so it is going to get a different reading. The temperature is one.
SE.27b.323.1	SE_27b	1.0	No, Because it would read how cold or hot is the bulb and that is what it would read.
SE.27b.331.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, because the student is measuring something else that might not have the same temperature as the student's hand, so the thermometer will read the temperature of the student's hand.
SE.27b.333.1	SE_27b	0.0	Yes, Because if you put your hand on the round part the air is not going to feel thermometer.
SE.27b.335.1	SE_27b	1.0	No, Because he will be tall so then that is why.
SE.27b.391.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, Because the bulb is the part that will see how hot something is so if you put your hand or finger on the bulb it would read your body temperature so it would rise.
SE.27b.396.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, No because your body has a temperature of 98.6 degrees F.
SE.27b.406.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, It would not read the same your body temperature is hotter than 5 Celsius.
SE.27b.408.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, It could not be the same because maybe what you are measuring is hotter or colder than your thumb so it would not come out accurate.
SE.27b.416.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, if someone held a thermometer by the bulb then the thermometer would sense your hands and the degrees would rise.
SE.27b.514.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, it would not be the same because it would be taking in the body temperature.
SE.27b.538.1	SE_27b	2.0	No, It would be warmer because the warmth and pressure of your fingers would give warmth to the bulb.
