LP.16d.106.1	LP_16d	0.0	It is harder to use this system than to use a single fixed pulley system.
LP.16d.137.1	LP_16d	2.0	You have to pull up and in the other system you will pull down.
LP.16d.142.1	LP_16d	0.0	The system is single movable system but the single fixed is easier to pull down.
LP.16d.149.1	LP_16d	0.0	Pull down.
LP.16d.152.1	LP_16d	2.0	It has direction advantage it can go up and down.
LP.16d.179.1	LP_16d	2.0	In a single fixed gravity creates a directional advantage. But in this one gravity pulls against you when pulling up.
LP.16d.212.1	LP_16d	0.0	You have to pull more ropes and a single fixed requires more effort.
LP.16d.214.1	LP_16d	0.0	You have to use more effort because you pull down.
LP.16d.244.1	LP_16d	0.0	The amount of ropes supporting it.
LP.16d.263.1	LP_16d	0.0	Single fixed pulley system a smaller effort and only one mechanical advantage.
LP.16d.290.1	LP_16d	0.0	Single fixed only has one rope connected to the load.
LP.16d.314.1	LP_16d	0.0	It would make it harder because if you divide 360 by how many supporting ropes a single fixed pulley has which is one then it would be 360 newtons for the effort that is 180 newtons harder to lift the load.
LP.16d.333.1	LP_16d	0.0	There are more materials.
LP.16d.346.1	LP_16d	0.0	You do not have to pull much rope with the single fixed but it is heavier.
LP.16d.350.1	LP_16d	2.0	The other disadvantage to this system is the effort is going up, so gravity is working against you.
LP.16d.353.1	LP_16d	0.0	The disadvantage is distance in this one and in a single fixed it is that the load's weight stays the same the whole time.
LP.16d.354.1	LP_16d	0.0	This system would take longer to set up.
LP.16d.356.1	LP_16d	0.0	Another disadvantage would be you have to pull more rope to get it where you want it to go.
LP.16d.357.1	LP_16d	2.0	The effort is going up which makes it harder.
LP.16d.364.1	LP_16d	2.0	You would have to pull 3 times as much on this than you would a single fixed. Also, it is easier to pull down than up.
LP.16d.382.1	LP_16d	2.0	In a single fixed you have directional advantage, and you pull the rope as far as the load moves, but a single fixed or single movable up has no directional advantage, and you have to pull the rope 3 times as far.
LP.16d.385.1	LP_16d	2.0	You have to pull up. It may give you mechanical advantage, but it does not give you directional advantage so it takes just as much work.
LP.16d.387.1	LP_16d	2.0	Single fixed you can pull down, which does not give you a mechanical advantage. But you do not pull the rope farther than the load.
LP.16d.389.1	LP_16d	2.0	This pulley system gives you a mechanical advantage the single fixed gives directional advantage.
LP.16d.419.1	LP_16d	0.0	Distance.
LP.16d.498.1	LP_16d	0.0	Another disadvantage might be that you cannot lift the load as high as you can in the single fixed because you are using more string.
LP.16d.499.1	LP_16d	0.0	You have to pull twice as much rope to lift the load.
LP.16d.571.1	LP_16d	2.0	A mechanical advantage. A single fixed pulley gives you a directional advantage.
LP.16d.592.1	LP_16d	2.0	Another disadvantage might be the size of the load. 360 newtons is quite a large load to be pulling upward!
LP.16d.610.1	LP_16d	0.0	You have to use less effort.
LP.16d.631.1	LP_16d	2.0	Compared to a single fixed pulley system, you would not have a directional advantage.
LP.16d.632.1	LP_16d	2.0	You do not have a directional advantage.
LP.16d.638.1	LP_16d	2.0	You have to pull up on this pulley system. On the single fixed you get a directional advantage.
LP.16d.647.1	LP_16d	2.0	This system has a directional disadvantage and the single fixed has a mechanical disadvantage.
LP.16d.108.1	LP_16d	0.0	A single fixed single movable has 2 more ropes than a single fixed. A single fixed system has one rope that separates the effort.
LP.16d.116.1	LP_16d	0.0	A single fixed does not change anything but a single fixed or single movable effort is 3 times the distance.
LP.16d.351.1	LP_16d	0.0	Another disadvantage would be that the system would be more time consuming.
LP.16d.595.1	LP_16d	0.0	The disadvantage would again be distance. On the single fixed, if you wanted to lift something 4 foot, you would have to lift it 4 foot. On a single fixed or single movable upward effort, you would have to lift it 12 foot.
