SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbj37-l2.qa123	OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q	1.0	when bulb a is out, bulb b and bulb c are still in a closed path with the battery.
SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbj39-l2.qa145	OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q	1.0	The path bulb A is on is a closed path with the battery even if bulbs B and C are out
SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbj45-l2.qa123	OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q	2.0	there are two paths. One contans bulb A alone so it does not affect the other bulbs. The other path contains both bulb B and C so if something happens to either one it will cause them to no longer be in a closed path with the battery.
SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbj45-l2.qa124	OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q	1.0	they are in separate paths
SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbj45-l2.qa126	OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q	1.0	bulb B is contained in the same closed path bulb C is in with the battery
SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbj48-l2.qa126	OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q	2.0	There are two separate paths in this diagram. One path is made up of bulb a and the battery. The second path is bulb b, bulb c, and the battery. If bulb a is out, it will not affect bulbs b and c since they will still be contained in a closed path with the battery. If bulbs b or c are out, bulb a will not be affected because it will still be contained in a closed path with the battery. If bulb b is out, bulb c will be out too since they are in the same path with the battery.
SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb4-l2.qa112	OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q	1.0	"bulb A is on its own path, so it doesn""t matter if B or C are damaged, A will still be on. bulbs B and C are on the same path so if one of them goes out, the other will too. B and C are not affect"
SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb16-l2.qa113	OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q	1.0	there are two seperate paths. Bulb A has its own path and bulb B and C are on the same path
SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb30-l2.qa112	OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q	0.0	bulb a is in a closed circuit path regardless of bulbs b and c. if bulb a is burned out, bulbs b and c are still in a complete circuit path. bulb b depends on bulb c, and bulb c depends on bulb b. if bulb b is damaged, bulb c will not come on becuase it is contained in the same circuit path as bulb b. if bulb c is damaged, bulb b will not come one because it is contained in the same circuit path as bulb c.
