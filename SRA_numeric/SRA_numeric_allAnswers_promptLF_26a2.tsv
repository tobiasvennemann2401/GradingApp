LF.26a2.399.1	LF_26a2	0.0	It so it better to hike. A has more lines.
LF.26a2.400.1	LF_26a2	0.0	It is more descriptive.
LF.26a2.404.1	LF_26a2	0.0	So you know what part of the mountain is the easiest part to climb and it has more details.
LF.26a2.407.1	LF_26a2	0.0	Because it has more description.
LF.26a2.437.1	LF_26a2	0.0	Because it is easier to read! And there is more information on it.
LF.26a2.446.1	LF_26a2	0.0	Because it tell where you are going.
LF.26a2.452.1	LF_26a2	1.0	Because a topographic map shows you if a place is going to be steep it also shows you what other roads or rivers to take well in other words it gives you more detail.
LF.26a2.453.1	LF_26a2	0.0	To see a bird's eye view which is better view than looking from land.
LF.26a2.462.1	LF_26a2	0.0	Because it has more and more direction to go.
LF.26a2.466.1	LF_26a2	0.0	Because it need to walk a little be that is why I think she recommend to her.
LF.26a2.472.1	LF_26a2	2.0	Because it would tell you where it is more steep and the elevation and the other one will not.
LF.26a2.474.1	LF_26a2	1.0	So they can see which is steep or not and safe.
LF.26a2.478.1	LF_26a2	0.0	Because it is a faster distance from the bottom.
LF.26a2.487.1	LF_26a2	1.0	Because she walled know now the side where and how steep they are and elevation.
LF.26a2.516.1	LF_26a2	1.0	Because a topographic map shows the steeps places and where is the best or dangerous place to be and the lines tell you where you are going like if you going around in circles.
LF.26a2.521.1	LF_26a2	1.0	I would think A because it shows the lakes and rivers and more details of it is location. Plus it shows the symbols of what is there.
LF.26a2.551.1	LF_26a2	1.0	So you would see the steep sides like 5000.
LF.26a2.552.1	LF_26a2	0.0	Because it gives better directions and trails.
LF.26a2.561.1	LF_26a2	1.0	It has more details and they show other paths beside just her's.
LF.26a2.564.1	LF_26a2	1.0	Because both the maps show the shapes of the landforms but a topographic map shows elevation and steepness.
LF.26a2.569.1	LF_26a2	2.0	Pam's friend recommend Map A because you could see the elevation, and see where things are.
LF.26a2.573.1	LF_26a2	1.0	Pam's friend recommended the topographic map because it shows the elevation of the mountain they are hiking.
LF.26a2.579.1	LF_26a2	2.0	It shows the contour lines so they will know how steep the trail is. Also they will recognize the shape of the land.
LF.26a2.584.1	LF_26a2	1.0	Pam's friend recommended to use a topographic map for the hike because in a topographic map you can see the profile of something which profile is a side view.
LF.26a2.585.1	LF_26a2	1.0	She would because it has more information.
LF.26a2.586.1	LF_26a2	2.0	They recommended it so they could see the steep parts, they are route, elevation, and shape.
LF.26a2.638.1	LF_26a2	1.0	Because it shows more directions and ways and it shows more places and more rivers.
LF.26a2.643.1	LF_26a2	0.0	Because it is like bird's eye view and so if you look top to bottom you will see almost every detail.
LF.26a2.647.1	LF_26a2	2.0	She recommended it because it informs them how many feet it increases. Also it shows you more locations so they know if they cross someplace they have gone too far.
LF.26a2.665.1	LF_26a2	2.0	Pam's friend recommended using the topographic map because you can see which side of the mountain is the steepest. That way you know where the non steep side. Also it snows rivers.
LF.26a2.669.1	LF_26a2	1.0	Pam's friend recommend using the topographic map because it has more information.
LF.26a2.673.1	LF_26a2	2.0	Pam's friend recommend the topographic map so she can tell which side is steeper. It also shows the elevations for the height.
LF.26a2.674.1	LF_26a2	2.0	Because she will know the elevation and which side is steeper.
LF.26a2.708.1	LF_26a2	1.0	Because it shows where rivers and lakes are. And it shows mountains and elevation.
LF.26a2.711.1	LF_26a2	0.0	It tells you where things are.
LF.26a2.747.1	LF_26a2	1.0	To see the different landforms in front of them.
LF.26a2.387.1	LF_26a2	2.0	It tells you the elevation so you hike the easiest way.
LF.26a2.481.1	LF_26a2	0.0	Because you where how big or 4.
LF.26a2.493.1	LF_26a2	2.0	She would recommend it because when they take the hike, they will know how steep the mountain is.
LF.26a2.507.1	LF_26a2	1.0	I think she would recommend this because a topographic map tells you more information for where you need to go.
