SE.16b2.111.1	SE_16b2	0.0	Because there is a 10 centimeters on the graph and put 10 centimeters with one and it will change because it is bigger and more space to store more heat.
SE.16b2.121.1	SE_16b2	1.0	It made me think but I had to choose 6 degrees Celsius. I picked between 3 and 9.
SE.16b2.122.1	SE_16b2	2.0	I just went halfway into 3 and 9 which were the 10 and 30 centimeters temperature at 10 minutes. But since 20 centimeters was 10 centimeters away from 20 and 30 so I went halfway into 3 and 9 and it was 6 because 6 is 3 spaces away from 3 and 9.
SE.16b2.124.1	SE_16b2	0.0	It will have the same materials like the other containers.
SE.16b2.132.1	SE_16b2	1.0	I used subtracting the B from A.
SE.16b2.136.1	SE_16b2	0.0	10 Celsius because I will think it would be much in the middle of 10 centimeters and 30 centimeters so that is why I picked 10 Celsius.
SE.16b2.144.1	SE_16b2	0.0	Because X 10 minute with 2 Y.
SE.16b2.154.1	SE_16b2	0.0	I think that it would be 10 Celsius that is changed.
SE.16b2.162.1	SE_16b2	2.0	Because on 10 centimeters is 3 and on 30 centimeters is 9 so in the middle of it is 6.
SE.16b2.164.1	SE_16b2	0.0	By using the graph it is saying that 12 Celsius is in the middle.
SE.16b2.165.1	SE_16b2	2.0	Because 20 centimeters is in the middle 10 centimeters and 30 centimeters so I guessed in between.
SE.16b2.166.1	SE_16b2	2.0	If the container is 20 centimeters in width the temperature should be between the 10 centimeters container and the 30 centimeters container.
SE.16b2.178.1	SE_16b2	1.0	I think the temperature for the new container is smaller, because one is smaller.
SE.16b2.179.1	SE_16b2	0.0	I think it would be 10 Celsius because it will take the container less time to get hot.
SE.16b2.191.1	SE_16b2	2.0	The new container would be in the middle of A and B. The temperature would have to be something in between 3 Celsius and 9 Celsius.
SE.16b2.255.1	SE_16b2	0.0	Change the container ever 20 minutes.
SE.16b2.319.1	SE_16b2	0.0	It will change because it could be it could change different places.
SE.16b2.327.1	SE_16b2	0.0	I just times it by how it is or just the way it is.
SE.16b2.339.1	SE_16b2	0.0	Because it went by 3 and that is why I pick that number.
SE.16b2.394.1	SE_16b2	2.0	Is by the between of 3 Celsius and 9 Celsius 6 Celsius so I looked at 10 and that is how I decided.
SE.16b2.397.1	SE_16b2	0.0	Because I looked at my graph to tell what it would be.
SE.16b2.403.1	SE_16b2	0.0	Because I looked at 10 centimeters and looked at 10 minutes and then I thought what was half of 3 and that is how I got my answer.
SE.16b2.496.1	SE_16b2	2.0	I chose 6 Celsius because you would be counting by 3's if there was a 20 centimeters long, because the length of each container was counting by 10's.
SE.16b2.504.1	SE_16b2	2.0	I decided it by saying to myself, Well 20 centimeters is in between 10 centimeters and 30 centimeters so I will make the temperature in between.
SE.16b2.507.1	SE_16b2	2.0	Well, 20 centimeters long is in between water heaters A and B, so I looked at their heating temperature between the 2 at 10 minutes then I would estimate what that middle number would be. And it is 6 Celsius.
SE.16b2.508.1	SE_16b2	2.0	I added A and B 10 minutes and divided the sum by 2 and got the average.
SE.16b2.516.1	SE_16b2	1.0	I decided that temperature because a 20 centimeters water heater would probably half of what it is.
SE.16b2.517.1	SE_16b2	0.0	Because table is going in a pattern on the 10 minute mark.
SE.16b2.528.1	SE_16b2	0.0	Because if you think of it it will be what you are looking for.
SE.16b2.533.1	SE_16b2	2.0	I decided it would be 6 Celsius for 10 minutes because it is counting by 3's. Also because the bigger it gets the hotter it would be.
SE.16b2.542.1	SE_16b2	2.0	Because it has the size between 10 centimeters and 3 centimeters and if you look at the table the temperature should be the middle.
SE.16b2.583.1	SE_16b2	1.0	The one that is 20 centimeters longer will not get as hot. Because it is longer. Because the longer it is the more time it takes.
SE.16b2.593.1	SE_16b2	0.0	I decided what the temperature was going to be because if you look at 10 minutes it will look like its going up by 3's.
SE.16b2.603.1	SE_16b2	1.0	I decide that the temperature is going to be less.
SE.16b2.610.1	SE_16b2	1.0	It would be less because it will be smaller than the other solar heater except the 10 centimeters one.
SE.16b2.612.1	SE_16b2	1.0	I think the new temperature change would be 6 because I look at it it looks like it adding by 3 so that I would think would be the temperature change.
SE.16b2.407.1	SE_16b2	1.0	I looked at the graph and saw that if 10 centimeters was 3 then it might be 6 centimeters.
SE.16b2.419.1	SE_16b2	1.0	I decided by looking at collector A's temperature at 10 minutes and doubled it.
SE.16b2.506.1	SE_16b2	0.0	Because it was the highest one so C got hotter.
SE.16b2.529.1	SE_16b2	0.0	Because almost all in the 10 minute time zone are in 3 degree intervals.
