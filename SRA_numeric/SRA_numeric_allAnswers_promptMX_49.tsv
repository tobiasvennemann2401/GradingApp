MX.49.113.1	MX_49	0.0	Y, y because it have to be less.
MX.49.128.1	MX_49	1.0	X, I chose x because x is more concentrated.
MX.49.140.1	MX_49	2.0	X, well concentration is when you compare equal amount of volume of 2 solutions and one heavier it is more concentrated so that is how I know.
MX.49.143.1	MX_49	0.0	Y, y has less material on bottom.
MX.49.151.1	MX_49	1.0	X, they have the same amount of water but cup x has more citric acid.
MX.49.181.1	MX_49	1.0	X, I know because when something is more concentrated it is also heavier.
MX.49.214.1	MX_49	1.0	X, cup x is more heavier.
MX.49.228.1	MX_49	1.0	X, because x is more heavier than cup y.
MX.49.248.1	MX_49	1.0	X, because is heavier then y.
MX.49.255.1	MX_49	1.0	X, cup x because it has more sugar in it.
MX.49.261.1	MX_49	1.0	X, x because it is heavier.
MX.49.267.1	MX_49	2.0	X, I know cup x is more concentrated because on the balance cup x is heavier and cup y is less concentrated.
MX.49.304.1	MX_49	1.0	X, how I know is because concentrated means the heaviest.
MX.49.356.1	MX_49	1.0	X, I know because when a solution has more solid, has a better taste, or weighs more it is more concentrated than the other one.
MX.49.381.1	MX_49	1.0	X, x has less room to move around and y has less room to move around.
MX.49.389.1	MX_49	1.0	X, I know that solution x is more concentrated.
MX.49.390.1	MX_49	1.0	X, Because it weighed more than cup y.
MX.49.391.1	MX_49	0.0	X, It is lighter.
MX.49.419.1	MX_49	0.0	Y, is more concentrated because cup x is on the floor and that is not good, right?
MX.49.421.1	MX_49	1.0	X, because it have more solid in it and it is heavier.
MX.49.423.1	MX_49	1.0	X, because it is heavier.
MX.49.426.1	MX_49	1.0	X, Because cup x is more heavier!
MX.49.431.1	MX_49	1.0	X, the more concentrated is cup x is heavier.
MX.49.437.1	MX_49	1.0	X, because the material gave it weight.
MX.49.453.1	MX_49	1.0	X, well on a balance is on the bottom and if it can lift the other solution it is more concentrated.
MX.49.455.1	MX_49	1.0	X, Cup x must have been more concentrated because it is heavier.
MX.49.502.1	MX_49	1.0	X, usually the heaviest cup on the balance is the most concentrated cup.
MX.49.527.1	MX_49	1.0	X, I think it is because it heavier. Remember I said I think.
MX.49.528.1	MX_49	1.0	X, it is heavier.
MX.49.532.1	MX_49	1.0	X, because it seem more concentrated then y.
MX.49.541.1	MX_49	2.0	X, cup x because it is more heavy.
MX.49.566.1	MX_49	1.0	X, I know cup x is the most concentrated because it weighs the most.
MX.49.569.1	MX_49	1.0	X, I know solution x is more concentrated because it is heavier than solution y.
MX.49.577.1	MX_49	1.0	X, They added more solute into the solution x than solution y. That is why solution x is heavier.
MX.49.613.1	MX_49	2.0	X, because x is on the bottom of the weighing thing while y is on the top.
MX.49.642.1	MX_49	1.0	X, because cup x weighs more than cup y.
MX.49.385.1	MX_49	2.0	X, cup x is a lot more concentrated because x is more heavy.
MX.49.392.1	MX_49	0.0	Y, I think y because x just because it is heavier does not mean that that is more concentrated. I think it means it is less concentrated because there is more room the more water the more room.
MX.49.467.1	MX_49	2.0	X, because solution x weighs more and has more solute.
MX.49.488.1	MX_49	1.0	X, because cup x has more stuff in it than cup y. cup y could still hold more.
