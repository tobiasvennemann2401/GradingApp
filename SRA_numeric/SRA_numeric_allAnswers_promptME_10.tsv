ME.10.101.1	ME_10	2.0	The motors will not run because it goes from the positive side to the positive side it has to go from positive to negative to work.
ME.10.102.1	ME_10	2.0	It will not work because the positive is going to the positive end, the positive need to run into the negative side for it to run.
ME.10.111.1	ME_10	0.0	It is not put to series.
ME.10.113.1	ME_10	1.0	Because it is hooked up negative to negative and positive to positive.
ME.10.118.1	ME_10	2.0	It needs to be negative to positive.
ME.10.120.1	ME_10	2.0	It will not work because it is negative to negative, it has to positive to negative.
ME.10.121.1	ME_10	1.0	The batteries are negative to negative.
ME.10.123.1	ME_10	2.0	It will not run because negative and negative and positive and positive are facing the same way.
ME.10.144.1	ME_10	1.0	Because the wires in between the D-cells are connected to the same end.
ME.10.147.1	ME_10	0.0	It is go out the wrong way.
ME.10.148.1	ME_10	2.0	The 2 negative ends of the D-cells are facing each other and the electricity cannot get out.
ME.10.154.1	ME_10	2.0	Both of the motors are hooked up to the positive wire, in order for it to work one has to be hooked to a positive and the other has to be hooked up to a negative.
ME.10.155.1	ME_10	0.0	They will not run because the electricity is going in a circle. And the electricity would be run in and out.
ME.10.174.1	ME_10	1.0	The motors at the right will not run because the electricity flows out of the negative side and they have the D-cells trying to make electricity flow out the positive side.
ME.10.176.1	ME_10	0.0	One battery is the wrong way.
ME.10.180.1	ME_10	0.0	It will not run because there is not enough D-cells to make both of them work.
ME.10.181.1	ME_10	2.0	Because a negative and a negative will not work.
ME.10.185.1	ME_10	1.0	The motor shall not run because electricity flows out of the negative side of the battery.
ME.10.191.1	ME_10	1.0	The motors will not run because the D-cells has to be switched around.
ME.10.192.1	ME_10	1.0	They will not run because the electricity gets stopped when it goes through the D-cells.
ME.10.208.1	ME_10	2.0	The motors shown at the right will not run because 2 negatives are connected.
ME.10.216.1	ME_10	0.0	The wires are not supposed to be connected like that.
ME.10.224.1	ME_10	0.0	Because you need more wires.
ME.10.226.1	ME_10	0.0	Because the motors do not have a minus side. They both have a positive side.
ME.10.227.1	ME_10	1.0	The motor at the right will not run because each one does not have a positive and a negative.
ME.10.245.1	ME_10	0.0	Because positive is facing it.
ME.10.247.1	ME_10	0.0	Maybe the left wire went out of energy so maybe the right one went out of energy so both of them are out.
ME.10.250.1	ME_10	1.0	If you look very closely the positive to positive and negative to negative. Positive and positive do not go together.
ME.10.253.1	ME_10	0.0	It will not work because it is dead battery.
ME.10.276.1	ME_10	0.0	Because one has the most power than the other one.
ME.10.284.1	ME_10	0.0	Because one D-cell has to be between the motors.
ME.10.293.1	ME_10	1.0	The motor will not run because it is in an open circuit.
ME.10.311.1	ME_10	1.0	The wires are at the negative end of the battery or D-cell so the motor is not going to run because the wire is at the negative end.
ME.10.314.1	ME_10	2.0	The D-cell is hooked up to the negative end and the other negative end and it cannot get any energy.
ME.10.318.1	ME_10	2.0	The negative end is pointing at the negative end so no electricity can flow to the motors.
ME.10.324.1	ME_10	1.0	The negative end are sharing so the D-cell is getting all the power.
ME.10.325.1	ME_10	2.0	Because electricity does not flow from positive to positive they flow from negative to positive.
ME.10.328.1	ME_10	2.0	The electricity is flowing from a positive to a positive end, when the negative should give the electricity to the motor and back to a positive end.
ME.10.105.1	ME_10	2.0	They will not run because electricity flows from negative to positive and on here it is negative to negative.
ME.10.107.1	ME_10	2.0	They will not run because the batteries have to be facing the same direction, negative to positive.
ME.10.119.1	ME_10	2.0	They will not run because negative is pointing to negative.
ME.10.214.1	ME_10	1.0	The motors will not run because they do not have negative they only have positives.
