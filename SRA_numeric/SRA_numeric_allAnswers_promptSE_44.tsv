SE.44.443.1	SE_44	1.0	The advantage of having a heat sink is that a heat sink absorbs more heat than a house without anything.
SE.44.489.1	SE_44	2.0	One of the advantages of having a heat sink in the solar house was that it would absorb heat and release it slowly so the house would stay warm.
SE.44.494.1	SE_44	1.0	The advantage of including a heat sink in a house would be that the house would probably stay warm.
