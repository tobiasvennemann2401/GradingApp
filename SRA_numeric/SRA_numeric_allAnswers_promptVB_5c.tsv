VB.5c.384.1	VB_5c	1.0	This tells me that the ice cube is melting.
VB.5c.388.1	VB_5c	2.0	How long it takes for an ice cube to melt.
VB.5c.394.1	VB_5c	2.0	The graph tells you the amount of time it took to make the ice cubes the sizes that they are.
VB.5c.397.1	VB_5c	1.0	The ice cube gets smaller and smaller.
VB.5c.399.1	VB_5c	2.0	As the time increases the size of ice cubes decreases.
VB.5c.406.1	VB_5c	1.0	The size of the ice cube went down.
VB.5c.416.1	VB_5c	0.0	This one show me the size of a ice cube and I think maybe how long it took to grow into a certain size.
VB.5c.423.1	VB_5c	0.0	The size of the ice cube and how many times it melts.
VB.5c.431.1	VB_5c	0.0	I think the graph tells me that the data decreases.
VB.5c.440.1	VB_5c	2.0	That an ice cube melts with time.
VB.5c.444.1	VB_5c	0.0	I think this graph tell me the times is about 25 seconds and size of ice cube is about 30.
VB.5c.452.1	VB_5c	0.0	The bigger the ice cube the slower. The smaller is fast.
VB.5c.462.1	VB_5c	0.0	This graph shows you that there is an equal amount of time.
VB.5c.466.1	VB_5c	2.0	This graph tells you what size ice cube melts faster in a certain amount of time.
VB.5c.469.1	VB_5c	2.0	The more the time the less size of the ice cube.
VB.5c.475.1	VB_5c	2.0	It tells you the size of the ice cube and the time.
VB.5c.477.1	VB_5c	2.0	This graph is telling me the size of ice cubes they got in a certain amount of time.
VB.5c.481.1	VB_5c	2.0	The size of the ice cube was at first solid but then it started melting and getting smaller and smaller in a certain amount of time.
VB.5c.483.1	VB_5c	2.0	The ice cube will get smaller when time goes by.
VB.5c.486.1	VB_5c	0.0	As time goes on size of ice cube stays the same.
VB.5c.489.1	VB_5c	2.0	As time goes on the size of ice cube goes down.
VB.5c.495.1	VB_5c	2.0	As time goes on the ice cube decreasing because it is melting.
VB.5c.497.1	VB_5c	2.0	As time goes on the size of the ice cube goes diagonal but it does not touch the line.
VB.5c.498.1	VB_5c	2.0	As time goes on the size of ice cube decreases.
VB.5c.501.1	VB_5c	1.0	The ice cubes are decreasing.
VB.5c.503.1	VB_5c	2.0	As time goes on the size of ice cubes goes down.
VB.5c.506.1	VB_5c	2.0	As time goes on the size of the ice cube melts.
VB.5c.511.1	VB_5c	0.0	As the ice cube sits it will melt faster.
VB.5c.525.1	VB_5c	0.0	As time goes on the size of ice cube stays the same.
VB.5c.530.1	VB_5c	2.0	As time goes on the size of ice cubes decrease.
VB.5c.533.1	VB_5c	2.0	As time goes on the ice cube decreases.
VB.5c.535.1	VB_5c	2.0	As time goes on the ice cubes decrease.
VB.5c.537.1	VB_5c	2.0	As time goes on the size of ice cubes will melt until it is all gone.
VB.5c.542.1	VB_5c	2.0	As time goes on the size of ice cubes is decreasing.
VB.5c.545.1	VB_5c	2.0	As time goes on the size of ice cubes is decreasing.
VB.5c.626.1	VB_5c	2.0	Time is increasing while ice is decreasing.
VB.5c.628.1	VB_5c	1.0	I think the ice cube is more like melting.
VB.5c.632.1	VB_5c	2.0	The size of the ice cube decreasing and the time is increasing.
VB.5c.634.1	VB_5c	0.0	Also, this one is decreasing.
VB.5c.638.1	VB_5c	2.0	Time is increasing was the cube is decreasing.
