FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb9-l1.qa196	BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q	0.0	Voltage measures the difference between the electrical states at two terminals. If there is a gap in the connection between the terminals, then a meter will measure a voltage.
FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb11-l1.qa186	BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q	1.0	When a light bulb is burned out in a closed path, all the light blubs go out. Voltage helps you to find where there is a gap in the path, which indicated a damaged bulb.
