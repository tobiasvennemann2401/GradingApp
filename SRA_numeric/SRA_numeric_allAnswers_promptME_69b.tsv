ME.69b.647.1	ME_69b	0.0	I chose because that is the answer.
ME.69b.651.1	ME_69b	0.0	Because 2 sponges is too much.
ME.69b.659.1	ME_69b	1.0	It depends on the power of the magnets.
ME.69b.661.1	ME_69b	2.0	Because the force field might be big enough to go through both foam blocks but it might not be.
ME.69b.662.1	ME_69b	0.0	In example A the magnets stuck. But example B it has 2 blocks and it does not matter if it is thick or thin.
ME.69b.663.1	ME_69b	0.0	I chose that answer because the foam blocks are too thick for the magnet to attract each other.
ME.69b.664.1	ME_69b	0.0	I choose that answer because in the picture the magnets look like they will fall to the ground but the magnets are still connected. So I think the magnets will fall.
ME.69b.665.1	ME_69b	2.0	It depends how strong the magnets are or how big the magnetic force is.
ME.69b.667.1	ME_69b	0.0	It will not stick because the magnets force field is not strong enough.
ME.69b.668.1	ME_69b	1.0	Because it is far away and I do not know how big the energy field is.
ME.69b.669.1	ME_69b	0.0	Because the 2 foam blocks are too thick.
ME.69b.670.1	ME_69b	0.0	Because the foam will be too thick with 2.
ME.69b.671.1	ME_69b	2.0	It depends on how big or thick the sponge is. It also depends on how strong the magnets are.
ME.69b.672.1	ME_69b	0.0	Because the magnets are too far away from each other and they fall.
ME.69b.673.1	ME_69b	0.0	The foam blocks are too thick so they will not work.
ME.69b.674.1	ME_69b	2.0	It might stick because the magnets are strong or it might not because the foam could be too thick.
ME.69b.675.1	ME_69b	0.0	Because the magnets have a magnetic field surrounding them.
ME.69b.676.1	ME_69b	0.0	The foam blocks are too thick, the magnetic force cannot go through.
ME.69b.677.1	ME_69b	0.0	Magnets only have such a big magnetic field.
ME.69b.678.1	ME_69b	0.0	Because 2 foam blocks are a lot thicker for the magnetic field to get through.
ME.69b.680.1	ME_69b	1.0	Because a magnet has a field around it and if it is too big that the field cannot reach the other magnet.
ME.69b.683.1	ME_69b	1.0	It is too thick.
ME.69b.684.1	ME_69b	0.0	I said the magnets will stick because magnets have really strong magnetic fields and those really strong magnetic fields so they can go through 2 foam blocks.
ME.69b.685.1	ME_69b	0.0	I chose that answer because 2 foam blocks too much for the magnet.
ME.69b.686.1	ME_69b	0.0	Because it is has 2 sponges.
ME.69b.687.1	ME_69b	0.0	I chose that answer because the gap between the 2 magnets is too big.
ME.69b.688.1	ME_69b	0.0	I chose this answer because there is too many foam blocks between the 2 magnets.
ME.69b.689.1	ME_69b	0.0	I chose that answer because the 2 foam blocks are so thick that the magnetism cannot get through them.
ME.69b.690.1	ME_69b	0.0	The foam blocks are thick so the magnetism will not be able to go through.
ME.69b.691.1	ME_69b	0.0	Because here I tried this with my reading book and it is thinner or it did not stick.
ME.69b.693.1	ME_69b	0.0	The magnets will not stick because 2 foam blocks have more space than one.
ME.69b.695.1	ME_69b	1.0	I chose this answer because it could be blocked or it could be attracted.
ME.69b.696.1	ME_69b	1.0	Depends on how powerful the magnets are.
ME.69b.698.1	ME_69b	2.0	I chose C. It might stick, but it might not because it depends on how strong the magnet is.
ME.69b.899.1	ME_69b	1.0	Magnetism is strong.
ME.69b.969.1	ME_69b	2.0	I chose that answer because whether it sticks or not depends on how powerful the magnets are.
ME.69b.646.1	ME_69b	0.0	There has to be a more fatter thing.
ME.69b.666.1	ME_69b	2.0	The magnets might be strong enough to get through the foam blocks or they are not strong enough to get through the foam blocks.
ME.69b.681.1	ME_69b	2.0	I chose that answer because the magnets might go through the foam blocks but it might not go through.
ME.69b.682.1	ME_69b	0.0	I chose that answer because I am not sure.
