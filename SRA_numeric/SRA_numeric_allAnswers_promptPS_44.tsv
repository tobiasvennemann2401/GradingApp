PS.44.105.1	PS_44	2.0	It is different because the little string makes a height sound.
PS.44.107.1	PS_44	2.0	The long string is low. And the short string is high.
PS.44.110.1	PS_44	2.0	If the small one is high the big one is low that is what it is for the harp.
PS.44.111.1	PS_44	2.0	The short string, will make a high sound and a long string will make a low sound. The short string and the long string are different because they are high and low.

PS.44.138.1	PS_44	2.0	A little string has a high pitch and a big string has a low pitch.
PS.44.141.1	PS_44	2.0	A short string the vibrations go faster so there is a higher pitch.
PS.44.142.1	PS_44	2.0	It is different because the short string has a high pitch and the long string has a low pitch.
PS.44.146.1	PS_44	2.0	Short string high pitch, long string low pitch.
PS.44.152.1	PS_44	2.0	Because the long one has a lower pitch the littler one has a higher pitch.
PS.44.154.1	PS_44	2.0	How it different is the shorter string has a higher pitch and the long string make a low pitch.
PS.44.157.1	PS_44	2.0	The long string is lower and the short string is louder.

PS.44.184.1	PS_44	0.0	It will be too low if you pluck the short string. It is loud when you pluck the long string.
PS.44.185.1	PS_44	2.0	Lowest string has the highest pitch. Highest string has the lowest pitch.
PS.44.189.1	PS_44	2.0	Because if you pluck a short string it will make a high pitch.
PS.44.191.1	PS_44	1.0	The littler string is louder then the big string.
