ME.17b.101.1	ME_17b	0.0	It will happen because that is turning the switch off or opening the switch.
ME.17b.105.1	ME_17b	0.0	Nothing will happen because you have to have a switch in front of the negative side to have it work.
ME.17b.107.1	ME_17b	2.0	That will happen because it will make a complete circuit with the bulb.
ME.17b.111.1	ME_17b	1.0	Because the battery is hooked to the switch that why.
ME.17b.115.1	ME_17b	2.0	It is completing the circuit, but the motor is not connected to a complete circuit, but the bulb is.
ME.17b.118.1	ME_17b	0.0	Because it is not complete.
ME.17b.120.1	ME_17b	2.0	This will happen because the switch is turning that way making a complete circuit.
ME.17b.143.1	ME_17b	2.0	Because it makes a complete circuit.
ME.17b.149.1	ME_17b	0.0	It is like turning on a light switch.
ME.17b.155.1	ME_17b	2.0	That would happen because the bulb is on the left and the electricity will be flowing that way.
ME.17b.159.1	ME_17b	2.0	It lets electricity go through.
ME.17b.173.1	ME_17b	2.0	It will happen because electricity is flowing to the light bulb.
ME.17b.179.1	ME_17b	2.0	That will happen because the switch will touch the wire and electricity will be able to flow.
ME.17b.180.1	ME_17b	2.0	It will happen because the motor and the bulb are not connected on the same wires.
ME.17b.183.1	ME_17b	2.0	It is a circle.
ME.17b.189.1	ME_17b	2.0	She will make a circle.
ME.17b.191.1	ME_17b	0.0	It will happen because right now it is a closed circuit, so if she moves it to the left it will be an open circuit.
ME.17b.192.1	ME_17b	0.0	That will happen because there is an open circuit so the electricity will travel to the source.
ME.17b.193.1	ME_17b	0.0	Well, it is going out too far, far enough to not work.
ME.17b.195.1	ME_17b	0.0	It will happen because it is in a running place.
ME.17b.206.1	ME_17b	2.0	It will happen because the switch is channeling the electricity to the light bulb.
ME.17b.247.1	ME_17b	0.0	Because if she would just move the it will light up the light bulb.
ME.17b.251.1	ME_17b	2.0	That happens because if you move it to the left she just closed that circuit.
ME.17b.253.1	ME_17b	0.0	Because left is to turn on and right is to turn off.
ME.17b.256.1	ME_17b	0.0	Because the D-cell is in the middle.
ME.17b.276.1	ME_17b	1.0	If she move the battery back it will light up.
ME.17b.277.1	ME_17b	0.0	That is one circuit.
ME.17b.278.1	ME_17b	2.0	That will happen because the switch will be closed.
ME.17b.280.1	ME_17b	2.0	Because it is closed and when it is closed it runs.
ME.17b.291.1	ME_17b	0.0	I learned it in class.
ME.17b.292.1	ME_17b	0.0	Because the bulb is not in a circuit.
ME.17b.313.1	ME_17b	0.0	Because it could not be a parallel circuit.
ME.17b.314.1	ME_17b	0.0	I think that because it is able to do that.
ME.17b.327.1	ME_17b	0.0	Because it is on an.
ME.17b.328.1	ME_17b	2.0	It will because as long as there is a connection and it goes from the negative to the positive.
ME.17b.119.1	ME_17b	2.0	That will happen because it is a complete circuit.
ME.17b.144.1	ME_17b	0.0	Because when you turn it left the circuit is open which means it goes off.
ME.17b.254.1	ME_17b	0.0	Because she only has one switch.
ME.17b.311.1	ME_17b	0.0	Moving the switch the light bulb will make it light up.
